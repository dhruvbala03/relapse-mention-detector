I find myself in the same old predicament I used to find myself in when I was younger. 
I'm 29 now, and the last time I truly kicked dope was when I was 26. Kicked a 3 year sub habit and came out more or less fine. The withdrawals sucked, but having experienced most of the other intensities of opiate withdrawal, it was very manageable (I'd like to thank clonidine and very supportive people in my life).

Fast forward, a relative in my family whom I was close with died from cancer, and, not willing to confront my own feelings, decided to reacquaint myself with oxy, vicodin, morphine etc. 

During this time I grew to also really appreciate adderall. I'm a musician in my spare time and, being happy to practice hours everyday, suddenly found a catalyst that drove many of my daily activities into higher gears. At least I think that was the illusion, but anyways.

At first I had it under control. Then I would use a little more, at which my conscience would protest! And I'd stop a short while, but all the while I'm noticing the interval of time gets shorter and shorter, and my equilibrium with myself, life, hobbies and passions, is slowly diminishing in optimism and energy. Not to mention strains on funds. 

So, wanting to nip this terrible demon in the bud, I've attempted so far 3 times this past 2 months to kick. I would get a few 8 mg strips of subs and slowly titrate down to as little as .025 mgs a day (I think... point is really really minuscule. The strips last me a week comfortably. 

I ran out of subs on Saturday and used kratom a few times to ensure my landing was soft as possible. No use it seemed though.. last night was a restless, sweaty, leg kicking shit show full of dark foreboding and misery. 

I'm blessed to have very chill work (and manage my own department) that I could take today off, but I can't keep doing this. I feel like I'm regressing back to that 23 year old racked with FEAR.

Fortunately I feel somewhat decent in this moment. I hope it lasts, I really do. I keep thinking maybe I should get some more kratom if it will help, but a voice inside tells me it's not good for the long run. 

It feels good to share this. I am going to beat this thing while it's still relatively easy going. It's different every time and it's always miserable, but it's like if I can't handle withdrawal this comparatively mild, what will I do if I ever find myself in worse circumstances? Maybe blowing 3 OCs every morning and evening until I'm bankrupt and staring at the clock telling me to wake up for work? Yea right.

During this time I grew to also really appreciate adderall. I'm a musician in my spare time and, being happy to practice hours everyday, suddenly found a catalyst that drove many of my daily activities into higher gears. At least I think that was the illusion, but anyways.

At first I had it under control. Then I would use a little more, at which my conscience would protest! And I'd stop a short while, but all the while I'm noticing the interval of time gets shorter and shorter, and my equilibrium with myself, life, hobbies and passions, is slowly diminishing in optimism and energy. Not to mention strains on funds. 

So, wanting to nip this terrible demon in the bud, I've attempted so far 3 times this past 2 months to kick. I would get a few 8 mg strips of subs and slowly titrate down to as little as .025 mgs a day (I think... point is really really minuscule. The strips last me a week comfortably. 

I ran out of subs on Saturday and used kratom a few times to ensure my landing was soft as possible. No use it seemed though.. last night was a restless, sweaty, leg kicking shit show full of dark foreboding and misery. 

I'm blessed to have very chill work (and manage my own department) that I could take today off, but I can't keep doing this. I feel like I'm regressing back to that 23 year old racked with FEAR.

Fortunately I feel somewhat decent in this moment. I hope it lasts, I really do. I keep thinking maybe I should get some more kratom if it will help, but a voice inside tells me it's not good for the long run. 

It feels good to share this. I am going to beat this thing while it's still relatively easy going. It's different every time and it's always miserable, but it's like if I can't handle withdrawal this comparatively mild, what will I do if I ever find myself in worse circumstances? Maybe blowing 3 OCs every morning and evening until I'm bankrupt and staring at the clock telling me to wake up for work? Yea right. ",1.0,"easier and easier, 32 days clean and happy to",,,,

I slipped up and took a few hits of crystal on Tuesday, like a dumbass, only to call the UA hotline to find that I have to submit a UA test. Instantly I thought, I WAS FUCKED, how could I have been so stupid. I beat myself up and thought ""Well, since I'm going to fail any way tomorrow I might as well keep getting high."" I stopped myself because I knew it wasn't the right thing to do. I smoked at 4 PM that day and went home and looked up all these crazy ways to flush my system but everything was crazy. So I decided to just drink a ton of water, about 2 gallons in less than 24 hours. I began drinking water at midnight and I had until 7 PM to go submit my UA. I took daily vitamins and everything, I swear I never pissed so much in 24 hours in my life. I wait until 6:45 PM to go take the UA, I read somewhere that the first portion of your urine is the most dirty so I began to piss and about half way through I began to fill the cup. He was taking much longer than usual to analyze it with the dipstick, until finally he said I was ok and to dump the cup, I shoulda dumped it as soon as he told me to because 4 seconds later he said ""Wait, let me go get another test, this one's not completely clear. Sometimes, they don't work right."" Instantly I was cursing myself for not dumping it right away. He got the second test and dipped it taking a while again and he said ""It looks like your positive for Methamphetamine, you sure you're clean?"" I began to play stupid and said ""Yes, it must be because of some medication I was taking because I thought I was sick, turned out to be allergies."" He then turned around and said ""Nah you're good bro, I was just messing with you. I got you good though huh?"" I was damn near panicking and was so relived he was joking. He began to tell me that he's not sure what OTC medication we can't take, but he told me to stay away from Benadryl because it causes a false positive for benzos. I gave a sigh of relief as god answered my prayers for a clean UA. I'm lucky, I took like 10 hits of that pipe and pretty much drowned myself in water and I barely passed. It's not worth the high and I was guilt tripping myself even before I knew I had to take a UA. I don't think I deserved that stroke of luck, but it was given to me and I'm so thankful. It makes me want to use meth less. I guess I needed a reminder of what I was missing out on, absolutely nothing. I know this has nothing to do with opiates but I just needed to vent this. still 1 month and 8 days clean from heroin though and I still manage to feel proud today.

Also I have things to look forward to. I got a job interview at a car dealership on Monday and if I get this job then I'll be the man I knew I could be. It seems promising but I try to stay humble. All I did was respond to a CL job posting with a voice mail and I got 2 different phone calls from the managers asking me to come in. They called me 3 times, left 1 voice mail and even a text. That voice mail must've been a killer. I fantasize about buying people who were there for me cars, I want to give back so badly to those who gave to me in my time of need and also pay it forward. Another thing is I made a new friend in my group meetings that I go to NA with and he invited me to his brothers birthday tomorrow. He's a really cool guy, we seem to be unlikely friends but we have each others back in recovery. He's 49 and I'm 22, on Tuesday he showed me a pic of his daughter who's 19 and she is HOT. I have a lot of respect for that man and I had the urge to say something about his daughter but I didn't. I'm nervous because my libido has come back full swing and I notice it when women look at me and I like the attention, who doesn't? I don't want to disrespect my new friend so I'm going to just try and be polite and not hit on his daughter, hopefully my urges don't get the best of me. If they do, and I happen to hit it off with his daughter then he might kill me because he's been to prison. He says I have a good heart and that I'm a good person but I'm only a man. Yeah I'm kind hearted and all but I want to hook up with his daughter. If I do then I'll tell him I'll treat her right and with the up most respect because she only deserves the best and I won't do her wrong. That's all wishful thinking though, but god damn it I told him my libido is back.

So far, I have reduced my dose by weighing the total weight of the generic Suboxone tablet's I take (100mg), and using a nail file to shave the pills down to just the right weight... this method works pretty well, minus the fact that my $30 digital jewelry scale is inaccurate by +/- 5mg (this actually makes quite the difference for me).

Here is the thing... I don't know if I can taper this last milligram of bupe as slow as I have been doing (1mg reduction daily of the remaining 55mg of the total pill weight). I would almost rather be in pretty intense withdrawal for a few days, as opposed to minor withdrawal for the months that this taper will take... both levels of withdrawal make me depressed anyway.

My theory is this: What if I were to skip two days of dosing completely (or take extremely small amounts), and then take  - say - 10mg less then the original weight on the third day? I would think that two days of total abstinence would cause my receptors to upgregulate to the new, lower dose much more rapidly... in this way, I could quickly make 10% (10mg) reductions in my pill weight, and speed up the adjustment period. The only downside to this approach would be that I would need to tough out 48 hours of total abstinence, but I know I am capable of this.

I really think - theoretically - this WOULD cause you to sensitize to the lower doses quicker, and my rationality for this is as follows: ACUTE withdrawal for most classical opiates lasts around the same amount of time, regardless of dose... therefore, the Mu receptors must be able to re-regulate to new levels of sensitivity at a variable rate, allowing them to adust in more-or-less the same time frame regardless of the magnitude of the adjustment... note: this observation is JUST for ACUTE withdrawal effects, not PAWS. 

Anyone have any feedback on this? Has anyone ever tried a similar ""staggered"" dose reduction?

I came here when I first starting reaching that ""rock bottom"". That point where you literally never have any spending money, taking days off work just because your pill connect is out, pawning my valuable items to give to pill dealer, not interested in college because I couldn't ever stick with commitments because I may or may not be able to get my fix, and I even lost my girlfriend, who was one hell of a girl. 

But anyways guys, I'm starting to find out that it is possible to get off opiates, IT IS POSSIBLE. This is going to be long but this is my story. 

One day after many many deep thoughts and heart to hearts with close fiends and people on here, I decided enough was enough and I told my mom straight up what I had been doing, everything. I went through my phone, blocked and deleted every last pill connect I had. I searched up a treatment place, which by the way had an excellent staff by the way. 

I signed up on May 5th 2014 and took my first dose of 25mg of methadone (The highest they could give you upon induction) and it helped but I ended up getting up to 55mg, which probably drew the process out but we'll get to that.

First off it was $30 for the first month (they still need clients), but after that it ended up being $79/week. Still better than the $80-$90/day that I was paying on the street. But after awhile even that gets irritating and you just want to be done, but it takes time. One thing I can say is that over a year later I still haven't touched a single painkiller.

I chilled on about 40 mg for maybe 4 months then from then I've just been dropping as it feels comfortable. The worst part is that when you go to thee places, you're drug tested every week, and since I started smoking a lot of weed, that meant that I have to go every single morning at about 10am, on saturdays its by 8am. 

But then I got to the point that I was just ready to fucking leave. I couldn't go on vacations anymore, it was just a pain. I decided to just say fuck it and flew down to a beach with some friends for 3 days with a single take home does from saturday. By the home I got home on Tuesday I was puking like I've never puked, stomach vile on stomach vile, my legs felt like fire ants and I could not keep them still, I got zero sleep, and was actually on the living floor thinking I would rather die than wait for the clinic to open. And that was ONLY 45 MGS. You are married to methadone but its beatable with a slow taper and strong will.

Over the past year I have gotten rid of every single bad influence friends in my life, become MUCH happier and outgoing, enjoy life, spend time with my grandparents. just a much happier life in general. Its a great feeling to know that if someone says ""hey you wanna go out friday?"" and I can say ""yes"" because I know I don't need that shit anymore. Also i finished my first year of college.

Right now I am currently on 2mg every other day (the machine only dispenses 5mg so I'm just taking a little less than half my dose to get by. Surprisingly the withdrawals are still noticeable on my days off but it's nothing really. Just a little less energy but I still go out and do stuff. I am functional.

Monday I plan to go to just a tiny sip, maybe 1mg for about a week, then use the next week to go IF I NEED TO. After that, I'm moving across the country to WA for the next 3 months to live with a friend for what hopefully will be a nice extended vacation away from the city that consumed me. I have no desire to ever go back. 

I just wanted to share this because I'm ecstatic that I will finally be free from the binding chains of the evil opiate bitch. Fuck her, Fuck that life.

Ever have a day when everything seems to be working against you? Do you go through periods when you are so busy taking people's inventories you can barely stand yourself? What about when you find yourself snapping at your co-worker or loved one for no reason? When we find ourselves in this bleak frame of mind, we need to take action. 

At any point in the day, we can set aside a few moments and take a ""spot inventory."" We examine how we are reacting to outside situations and other people. When we do, we may find that we are suffering from a plain old ""bad attitude."" A negative outlook can hurt our relationship with our Higher Power and the people in our lives. When we are honest with ourselves, we frequently find that the problem lies with us and our attitude.

I was on the H for a couple years. Pills before that. Finally stepped up and ask for help. That was a little over 2 years ago. 

Ill save the long story and try to just hit the points.
I got into a suboxone doctor the first thing the following morning. It was great! I no longer had that feel of urgency I felt ever morning waking up and knowing I had to find money or someone to meet up with. I took ahold of that feeling. I didnt abuse it and I tapered down to about 1mg a day. But I just coulndt jump. I was terrified of withdrawal because I never had to go fully through with it. 3 years of use and I only went maybe 16-18 hours without, or needing that whole time. So I had no idea what to really expect after all that time...  

Anyway, My Doctor is great. I have been told this next move is insane and that I should ""get clean and turn him in!"" more than once... So save it cause I am about to prove you wrong. He put me back on Oxycodone. It is a shorter acting opiate so withdrawal would only be a few days and not over a week with Subs. Also, the theory was ""Oxy opens the flow from receptors more than Subs, so less, is more."" He trusted me. I gave him bi weekly urines. And I never abused them. I was on Subs for two years already. I pretty much had a ""normal"" life back. I had no connects anymore or the money left if I did anyway. So I didnt fuck myself. 

Over the past few months I tapered at my own speed and again, my Doctor is great. I kept to my tapper and went from 15's to 10's and finally 5mg pills. I was down to 15-25mg a day. And I got to that point again where I was scared to jump. But then I looked at myself in the mirror (not really:dramatic effect) and told my self ""Its time to step up!""! I was tired of being a slave to this shit in any form anymore. Always have to make sure I had my pills for the day. Yeah, they were there waiting for me, but still it just felt like... A slave. And I'm just tired. I havn't been ""high"" in over 2 years. Fuck this shit anymore. 

I took my last 5mg Oxy on Sunday Night. It is now 48hours. I took some Imodium yesterday just to be safe. No Chills. No cramps. No aches. No vomiting. No diarrhea. No shakes. No sleep loss. No heat flashes. No sweating. ...Nothing. I feel great! I am at a point now where I feel like if something was going to happen, it should have happened. I think... I might be in the clear. I think a large pond of ice formed under my feet and I just skated an Olympic figure skating spectacle!! 

I dont want to sound like I am bragging or rubbing it in anyones face. I have never come across a story where someone was just able to walk away.Especially a story like mine where the chance to abuse is staring you in the face. It took a long time. But I stayed strong and I kept my addiction under control. I worked MY program. I didnt cheat myself. And that is all that really matters. No matter how you make it happen, you can make it happen! I highly HIGHLY recommend a tapper if you can. But just like any other rehab or detox program you really have to want it. You cant lie to yourself. I never did. I never wanted to do the things I did or tell the lies I have to the people I love again. 

So I guess thats it. I just wanted to give an update. 

Music has been a great help the last two days. I gave you guys some songs that expressed (emotions run high through this!) how I was feeling. Well, today I feel like I am most likely in the clear... As far as anything physical goes. I will continue working on my recovery of course... I am just happy I overcame my fear and finally jumped from the cliff.

SO LETS GO TO THE SHOW!!! FUCKING PARTY WITH ME!!!

I'm just in one of those dull moments where I'm struggling to find some joy and feelings outside of sadness. 

I wish I could harness some of the good from yesterday and bring it back. I don't know... it's just been a tough 12 hour stretch. I have accomplished quite a bit over days 1-5, I can't forget about that. Those are days I don't have to relive, today has been the hardest thus far. Weird.

I began with OxyContin, crushing and snorting 20-30mg 1-3x a week in May 2010. By the end of the summer of 2010 I was eating 40-60mg crushed 2-4x a week. By New Years 2010 I was eating 100mg crushed OC and was starting to binge, go hard for 4-5 days and then stop for a couple weeks. This was when I first got some withdrawal symptoms.

By the end of summer 2011 my use was ridiculous. I was using nearly every day, 160-240mg OC oral or snorting 32-48mg of Dilaudid. I began shooting on September 21st, 2011. 80mg OC or 16mg Dilaudid was usually done every evening for Fall 2011. I wanted to quit in December 2011 and I did for 10 days. The withdrawals weren't fun but they were also not too bad, increased sensitivity to pain, some diarrhea, some insomnia.

Over the next 6 months my use was more sporadic as money was running low. In February however I shot 8-16mg Dilaudid most mornings and evenings and the quit for a week and again, just a flat mood, tiredness and the above symptoms.

So I started shooting Heroin in April 2012. Usually just 100-150mg 1-3x a week until June 2012. July 4th 2012 I went on Methadone and stopped using. I started at 20mg/day but was at 65mg/day by early November. I then OD'd on 4mg Clonazepam, 6mg Etizolam, 900mg Pregabalin, 2100mg Gabapentin, and 215mg Methadone. Breathing tube, IVs, I think I was taking 2 weak breaths / minute before I was put on life support.

So now I am 45 days into real recovery I suppose. I started to see my addiction counsellor again, started to taper methadone from 65mg/day to 30mg/day in about 4 weeks. I'd feel rough the first day or two after a drop and then quickly re-adjust. I started in-patient two weeks ago. Went off Methadone for 48 hours and then on to Suboxone (8mg/day). They tapered me quickly (8,8,8,6,4,2,2, then nothing). 

What I'm getting at is I am now a week clean of Suboxone, 2 weeks clean of Methadone, and although this is my worst withdrawal yet and at times has been quite uncomfortable, it is NOTHING compared to what I read described on here. Increased anxiety, deflated mood, tired, increased sensitivity to pain, some diarrhea but not bad, cold sweats for 3-4 days, but I still get 4-6 hours sleep / night which is better than I would get after a night on heroin. I haven't puked or felt nausea. I feel like I have the flu, some fever-like symptoms and that's it.

How did I grow such a high tolerance to opiates, have long acting ones in my system at all times for the passed 6 months, shot them for 10 months prior to that, and feel like this is really no big deal?

I know it probably doesn't matter much in the long run but I'm curious if any of you could help me figure out what I have in store for me or how long these WD's are going to last. 

I was initially addicted to PST, and was tapering off of that without too many problems. I got down to a pretty small dose but was having issues ""jumping off.""

Last week I was an idiot and took a bunch of vicodin for like two days. I thought I could get away with this. (PSA: you can't. Not with opiates at least.) 

The day after I took the vicodin, I had much more intense WD's than I had before. Whereas with the PST my WD's were mostly depression, I started getting much more intense and worse WD's after this. I guess it reset my WD's. I started getting CRUSHING depression, intense, crippling anxiety, totally restless, shitty body load. It kept forcing me into these horrible negative feedback loops that I used to get when I was very depressed, so that was concerning.

I was also using etizolam to deal with the WD's last week, for 5-6 days. I thought perhaps the intense anxiety was due to an etizolam habit I was developing so I got scared and stopped that as well. 

It's been about 5-6 days now and the symptoms suddenly changed. They're no longer mainly mental, but now I have lots of physical symptoms, like the shits, feeling like I have the flu, sneezing, etc. Which I've never gotten previously during a WD. 

Today is the first day I decided not to take my PST dose and just ""jump off."" So based on previous experience, I think that will make me feel shittier for the next day or two. But I'm not sure what's going on with whatever WD's I kicked in by taking the vicodin and etizolam.

I'm just really confused by all of this, my WD symptoms seem to keep changing and getting better then worse again, if anyone has any idea what I'm in store for I'd appreciate it. 

I'm mainly wondering because I have to fly out of my state in three days, and I have a bunch of stuff I have to do before that, and if I keep feeling like this I dunno if I'm gonna get it all done, honestly. Work yesterday was absolutely hellish.

tl;dr - what tips do you have to helping keep a relationship together throughout treatment/recovery?  things to talk about, things to think about or plan for? 

So, within the past 6 weeks, I've admitted to my gf that I've been on-and-off addicted to opiates for years (she had no idea... I had years of clean time in between, but I definitely had problematic behaviors, I never considered myself an addict or did any therapy/work/etc about my addiction).  Since 6 weeks ago, I've entered outpatient treatment, have been attending meetings, and I did a taper of my drug (tramadol) from 25-30 pills (1250-1500mg) to 2 (100mg) a day.  

I was just talking to a friend who was in rehab/treatment for alcholism, has worked through AA, has 5 years clean, and she was telling me I have to be very careful about my relationship.  I already knew I have fucked up heavily, sown mistrust and pain into our relationship, but my friend was mentioning things I hadn't even considered...e.g. that my idea of recovery might be different from my gf's; that the process of recovery may be so self-involved, self-focused that my girlfriend may feel like I'm only focused on myself; that my girlfriend might see me as a different person (or maybe the process of recovery will be so major that I will be a different person) afterwards, etc. 

Anyways, my gf is still here, still supporting me, but what things have you done to help keep a relationship from falling apart during recovery? 

I've been with this woman since 2006, known her since 1998, and she and I are big parts of each others' families.  Right now my #1 goal is recovery, because without recovery, I'll lose more than this relationship.  however, I do not want to lose her and I want to do whatever I possibly can right now to ease her path, show her the progression of my recovery without overloading her with ""support duty"", etc.  

my taper ends on JAN 1.  new year, new days.

They would lament together about how they wanted to tell their families, friends, loved ones about their problem, but didn't think they could ever actually do it. So once he did, this friend was of course cut out of his life.

When it all happened, I sent his friend a message saying that my SO finally came clean, and they would no longer be in contact with each other. I did add that we both hoped his friend would find the same courage and get the support he needs from his family, and the help he needs for himself. And that we both wished him all the best with his future.

It turns out, this friend did indeed get help, with support of at least some of his family. Yay! And my facebook snooping shows he's been clean for a little over two months.

Now my problem is, my SO other was friends with this guy for about 20 years (only about 2 of those years were they using together). I know he misses him, not as a drug buddy, but as a friend.

On the 26th of august after fighting with my parents for two weeks, deciding there is no hope for a relationship between us, I walked out.  I did not even mean to walk out. I just wanted some time away from them to emotionally regain my bearings.  On a whim my parents decided to head back to NJ for the weekend. I make a few calls and one of my friends is on his way to pick me up.

I say I am going out and they tell me I can not leave.  At 22 years of age I am not fucking staying home because my parents told me I can not leave. Also I am on the edge of becoming violent. At this point I had stopped smoking for two weeks.

My friend (one from the group that sat me down and told me I needed to stop shooting heroin) drove 45 minutes to come get me and they are telling me to tell him to turn around and go home.  I grab my bad and head for the door and they tell me if I leave to not come back.

I walk out of the door and we make it four miles before I have him stop so I can grab a pack of cigarettes.  I find out the plan for the night is to go to the Black Dog in Staten Island. We meet up with the rest of the crew head out that way to meet up with some more friends and we have a killer night.

Weekend goes by as one for the history books and after that all my friends have work in the morning and need a place to go. A friend from that Friday night drives me back up to my home town and ends up spending a few days with me.

After that I am by myself. I look out the window and In my neighbors driveway is his oldest sons girlfriends truck. I call the son and he is on tour and will be home in a few days.  Yay an escape from my solitude.

It became a routine, when I come through all my friends think its time to get wasted and have a good time. Weed comes out, Bottles come out and good nights were had. After about two weeks of this some friends at a place we all call ""the Farm"" ask me what I am doing. I do not have an answer.

It was a good wake up call that I can not live like a nomad and have fun all day every day no matter how much I want to.

I start putting in job applications everywhere. I do not care about the job, the hours, the pay, I need work. Sure I need the money, but If I am not keeping busy I am eventually going to go back to heroin.

Later on after I have so many job applications in that someone is bound to hire me, I go out to guitar center with my neighbor and I get a call from my mother. She is shutting off my phone. Now all those jobs I applied for can not contact me and I am running out of money.

I go back home fucking irate. I start getting suicidal thoughts and start drinking.  Blatantly abusing alcohol but who cares its not like I plan to make it into tomorrow anyway.  I am chocolate wasted with a rope tied to my rafters with the other end tied around my neck and I hear the front door open. I take the rope off and make it look like I was not just about to kill myself and go greet my neighbor and his girlfriend who came to check on me.  They see how much a one minute conversation with my mother fucks me up emotionally and decided to spend the night with me to make me feel better.

My friend who drove me home after the first weekend hooks me up with a burner and I am back on the job hunt again.
The next sunday I take him up to the farm and show him how we do it in the backwoods where I am from. He has a good night, and somewhere between being drunk, stoned and sleep deprived, I share my desire to learn to blow glass with one of the guys who lives there.  The next morning I log into Facebook to see designs for a kiln and a tag saying I am needed to do this project.  I head back over there the next day and start building a kiln.

They throw a party the next friday night and the project is receiving a lot of criticism. We set out to show everyone we can build a furnace and blow glass with it. We start procuring materials and making designs and building formwork to cast it out of concrete.

My best friend comes out to the farm the night of the party and lets me and my buddy mike (the one who drove me home the first weekend) in on a little secret.  One of our best friends is getting engaged and we are going ring shopping in the morning. The night becomes a blur and then we all go shopping for a ring hung the fuck over.

I start getting to a point where I am tired of drinking and getting stoned all the time.  


My mother then shuts the water off in the house.

My friend mike then tells me to come live with him and I will find a job close to his house and start contributing to the rent when I can. 
My sister tells me that my mother wants me to come home and go to rehab.  Fuck. That. Shit.

Being around my parents has made me suicidal.  I have not talked to them since that evening at guitar center.  Emotionally I am still a wreck, but I am doing better.  I am slowly but surely getting on my feet.  I have two dollars and forty cents in my bank account and I am at peace.

I can not say I am clean, but I have lost count of how many days it has been since I last used.  I am not tempted to use; and I have to business allowing myself to become so bored that I start thinking about using.

Right now I am perusing a job as a make up artist. I have always liked doing make up, almost as much as I like working on trucks.  It is a load off of my shoulders not having to face the bullshit that my parents put me through.

My mother said some things about me to my neighbors father, I headed back up that way to straighten things out in person.  We had a short but very productive talk where I told him everything. I told him about my heroin addiction, I told him about my fighting with my parents. I told him I walked out and that I need to be on my own for my own sake.  He fully understood but he told me to keep in touch with my parents. They deserve to know that I am alive.  After this I am going to send them an e mail. That is all they are going to get. In my eyes they do not even deserve that but I respect this guy and I will follow his advice.


I have always been supportive of people who are struggling.  Now I am fighting for something better and the people around me right now have been amazing. its just tons of support. Since I left, I feel alive, I see my friends, I am working on cool projects without all the emotional abuse I was putting up with.  Being out of work and trying to pay all the good that has been coming to me forward, I have been fixing all of my friends cars and houses and doing everything I can to help those around me.  I feel like there is hope for me to be happy some day.

On the 26th of august after fighting with my parents for two weeks, deciding there is no hope for a relationship between us, I walked out.  I did not even mean to walk out. I just wanted some time away from them to emotionally regain my bearings.  On a whim my parents decided to head back to NJ for the weekend. I make a few calls and one of my friends is on his way to pick me up.

I say I am going out and they tell me I can not leave.  At 22 years of age I am not fucking staying home because my parents told me I can not leave. Also I am on the edge of becoming violent. At this point I had stopped smoking for two weeks.

My friend (one from the group that sat me down and told me I needed to stop shooting heroin) drove 45 minutes to come get me and they are telling me to tell him to turn around and go home.  I grab my bad and head for the door and they tell me if I leave to not come back.

I walk out of the door and we make it four miles before I have him stop so I can grab a pack of cigarettes.  I find out the plan for the night is to go to the Black Dog in Staten Island. We meet up with the rest of the crew head out that way to meet up with some more friends and we have a killer night.

To help someone else in a similar boat? Just to give the story of what I consider to be the ""closet addict"".
Maybe one of the most common kind? Either way... quick backstory -

Male - Just Turned 29 - Been married for 14 months - No Kids (For Now) - Wife and I have decent jobs that keep us comfortable middle class for now.  I'm a health nut/good shape/opiate addict. 

My DOC is oxy, started out with prescription from an old doctor that no longer prescribes after a 1.5 prescription. When the prescriptions would come to and end, I would live in and out of withdrawals/relapses through a buddy 2 hours away who could find them. So yea... I've mad a lot of 5 hours commutes over the last few months and blown a ton of money. (30-100mg a day habit - Tons of random clean time ranging from 3-33 days) I've fortunately never been exposed to heroin, I cannot tell myself I wouldn't have tried.

I've luckily been able to stay on top of all finances/hold my job/keep my health... but I feel all of this about to flip on its axis and I know I want/need out more than ever. The last 1.75 years of my life have been artificial bliss and I want the old me back and not live this torture any longer. I think it's hurts more knowing the people you love the most suffer the most, I just can't bare it any longer. 

My family is aware of the battle I'm starting to endure... I'm armed with all the tools/supplements I've gathered. I'm 36 hours in at the moment, spent most of the day on the couch, managed to get down some supplements/protein shakes/bowl of chili. No nausea, just the bad morning shits and terrible anhedonia/restlessness/emotional nut job. 

I plan on logging my days on here hoping that somebody is in a similar boat. Also lookin for some motivation/accountability. I've lurked here during my last few months of the withdrawal/relapse phase. I just feel like I still have the ability to walk away and never feel this way or fight this battle again if I don't want to. I know it's a long road but I'm tired of dragging the people that love me down the road alongside. 

Thank you in advance. You guys are all amazing people.

I'd say at my worst i'm taking maybe 750mg a day, maybe a tad more. I know it would take a long time but thinking of dropping 60mg a week off my daily intake. Only problem is i've got a load of stressful stuff going on in my life at the minute (dont we all?) and the big problem is I cant let my wife or family find out. I could really do with their support but my marriage would be over if I came clean. I'm also learning to drive at the minute (i never drive high, dont worry) and its really stressing me out.

Only problem is i've got a load of stressful stuff going on in my life at the minute (dont we all?) and the big problem is I cant let my wife or family find out. I could really do with their support but my marriage would be over if I came clean. I'm also learning to drive at the minute (i never drive high, dont worry) and its really stressing me out.

It seems like every other week (and every night near the end), I'd fantasize about getting clean and living a life without mind-altering substances. I'd list out in my head an entire plan to achieve that goal. 

Taper, Suboxone, Imodium, withdrawal, and then happiness. Who needs 12 steps when you can do it in 5?

The plan was always so perfect in my mind, and I'd fall asleep optimistic, surrounded by ""my last high."" The following morning, that internal conversation was forgotten and I was left scrambling for money and drugs.

That part of the addiction made it so much more difficult to deal with. I'd squander all of my funds on as much dope for that ""last binge,"" only to get pissed at myself the following day for leaving myself with nothing. Near the end of my using, my anxiety was at incredible peaks. Family, friends, and the police were onto me. I was entering hoods where I had stolen from countless street dealers, seeking out new ones while attempting to avoid the threats of old ones. At the time, it was simply routine. In retrospect, it was the scariest and most anxiety-ridden time of my addiction.

Today, I have found myself in the most stressful period of my recovery. I don't want to get into details, but I broke up with my girlfriend last week, only to be told that she is having some medical complications. So I put on my big-boy-sober pants, tossed aside all of the BS that has been going on with us, and have accompanied her to late night hospital visits, multiple doctor appointments, and have been an open ear for her. The doctors are baffled and each one has given us a conflicting report as to what is going on. All I can do is offer my support and a hand for her to hold. The little boy inside of me that couldn't cope with life and used drugs as a numbing agent keeps telling me to run away from this, that I'm not strong enough, and that she just doesn't matter anymore. Then he tells me to pop her prescribed Percocets. Fortunately, my conscience and inner morality is the louder voice in my head today.

There is progress in all of this. As difficult as it may be, I have the ability to be there 100% for her and her daughter, regardless of the shape our relationship is in. I have the ability to tell that little voice ""No."" I find myself today being proactive instead of reactive, truly the biggest gift sobriety gives to any of us: the chance to lessen the impact of inevitable, bad situations, instead of attempting the evasion of these events until they catch up with us tenfold.

They say life gets better and easier when you get clean. Keeping in perspective just how bad things used to be, I couldn't agree more.

I was a 2 Bundle a day, sometimes more if I could hustle it user, I know damn well what I was using was cut with Fent plus heavy drinking and whatever else was going on at whatever party I was at.  I ruined an 18 dollar an hour job, which as a high school grad  is pretty good, I crashed a truck, lied to borrowed or stole from everyone and everything and damn near blew up my marriage. 

But now, 90 short days later-  I've got one job offer on the table, another I'm waiting to hear back from. My family is starting to trust me again, and this Monday I finally get to go home and be with my wife and dog full time. I made some friends in rehab that I've been able to keep in touch with and we're all doing pretty well which im thankful for too.

I don't have this figured out by any means, im still very new and very cautious, but I try and start each day on the right foot by waking up and reading just for today, daily reflections and then a bunch of qoutes from philosophers and whatnot. The daily awakening apps are great for that. 

I've been keeping an open mind and taking suggestions. Like when it was suggested I drop contact with people from before, it sucked  because one of the guys has been my best friend since 8 years old but I can't let our history ruin my future and (I read this one today) if I think about it like I'm trying to grow something in a garden, you have to clear out the weeds.

I was a 2 Bundle a day, sometimes more if I could hustle it user, I know damn well what I was using was cut with Fent plus heavy drinking and whatever else was going on at whatever party I was at.  I ruined an 18 dollar an hour job, which as a high school grad  is pretty good, I crashed a truck, lied to borrowed or stole from everyone and everything and damn near blew up my marriage. 

But now, 90 short days later-  I've got one job offer on the table, another I'm waiting to hear back from. My family is starting to trust me again, and this Monday I finally get to go home and be with my wife and dog full time. I made some friends in rehab that I've been able to keep in touch with and we're all doing pretty well which im thankful for too.

I don't have this figured out by any means, im still very new and very cautious, but I try and start each day on the right foot by waking up and reading just for today, daily reflections and then a bunch of qoutes from philosophers and whatnot. The daily awakening apps are great for that. 

I've been keeping an open mind and taking suggestions. Like when it was suggested I drop contact with people from before, it sucked  because one of the guys has been my best friend since 8 years old but I can't let our history ruin my future and (I read this one today) if I think about it like I'm trying to grow something in a garden, you have to clear out the weeds.

WILL WHAT YOU FEAR EVENTUALLY GET YOU?

""IF YOU have low self worth, particularly if it is based on not finding and expressing your authentic self or your true path in life, you can actually shrink the size of your brain, resulting in memory loss and overall mental decline. OK, your first reaction to that statement might be incredulity, but there is science to back this up.
A study done at Mcgill Uniin Montreal surveyed 92 seniors over a fifteen year periodusing brain scans and quesionnaires. The brains of folks with low self-worth had atrophied until they were one-fifth smaller then the people who felt good about themselves. They also performed worse on memory and learning tests. Moreover, a self-fulfilling prophecy factor was found- anxiety about memory loss leads to negative thinking, which in turn can trigger the very mental impairment that was feared.

A subsequent study, in 2005, by the same team of McGill researchers found this brain atrophy phenom occuring in young people 20 to 26 y/o. But the effect was also found to be reversible if self-worth is rebuilt by first focusing on gratitude for the positive things in everyday life, however tiny and seemingly insignificant those things or moments might be. This exercise helped boost self-esteem by lowering stress and raising the ""Internal Locus of self control"", a persons perception of being in control of his or her outcomes in life"".

I skipped the benadryl last night, but kept with the melatonin and nyquill. Managed to avoid most of the RLS, so I really think the benadryl might have been contributing to that. 

Last night (night 2) I fell asleep about 10, and managed to sleep until about 4ish, then sort of dozed in and out until 7 when the alarm went off. I was wide awake for the last few hours though. 

Totally still feel foggy, and 100% out of energy already, but I'm going to go take a shower and hit the grocery store after I post this. The sun is out today, and I don't think I'm going to get to see it again for a few days yet, so I'm going to take advantage.

Most of my physical symptoms are tapering off. I'm about 70 hours clean again, getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to count the hours, and more to count the days. I know I still have an uphill battle, but the easy WD is a blessing I'm not going to fail to acknowledge.  I want to say to anyone who doesn't get it easy, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just trying to be thankful for what I've been given. 

Today is for sure a low energy day. I just don't feel like doing anything. But I thankfully still don't have much in the way of sadness or anxiety, both of which hit me HARD last time. Last time I couldn't feel any joy at all. I've laughed out loud a few times today alone, and chuckled at things the whole way through this one. I do have that low motivation + energy, which sucks because I have so much to do.  That ties into this next piece.

My biggest issue today are those ""You were so much better / more productive / happier on pills"" type feelings. It's sad that I can't remember what I was like before I was taking pills. I know that when I was on them, I WAS more productive right after I had taken then. I would usually dose for the first time about 11 AM, then about noon be doing 'something' productive like using my lunch break to clean my kitchen (I work from home) or get some laundry done or something.  Logically, I feel like I couldn't have gotten to where I am if I was always lazy. I've done my own laundry for like 15 years now. I only abused pills heavily one of those 15. So I know I can do laundry without needing a crutch. I've been doing this exact job (more or less) for over 3 years now. Only 1/3 of those were on pills. So I know I can do my job without them. I did all these things before. I just have to make myself remember how. 

I'm going to grab some St. Johns Wart and a good multi-vitamin, to try and help my brain rebuild itself. It's going to start snowing tonight, and I'm going to make sure I acknowledge the wonder my kids feel when they see it. 

Yesterday, I had a few people message me and thank me for quitting. One person mentioned how they wish they had quit when they were ahead like me, and described how much they hurt today. Another told me they lost someone to the same sort of battle I'm struggling with. It's really helpful, hearing that I'm right about where this path will lead me. There is nothing good for me down that way. Nothing positive. Those of you who replied or messaged me made a difference, and I hope you know that. I love you all, and I want only the best things for all of you.  We are all going to get through this.

Firstly, they insisted that the heroin/oxy/fent sub taper program was just fine for my poppy seed addiction that I migrated to after a moderate oxy habit (when laws caught up with supply in my country).

I went into WD after the 7 day sub taper which started at 12mg (waaay too high for PST), because due to the long half life of my DOC, 7 days didn't really taper me off. So naturally I was a bit disgruntled when I was refused a few more days of subs when I let them know I was back in WD. I ended up relapsing, and like clockwork with stupid addicts, was back using opiates and drinking more than ever within a week.

So I went back into detox 6 weeks later after I decided I needed another try at quitting. The head nurse asked if I started my naltrexone script after my last detox, which was meant to keep me clean of opiates and cull some of the alcohol cravings. I told her I didn't make it through the 7 day period without relapsing, so I never made it to even using the script, but I still had it. The nurse said I should start naltrexone while starting my sub taper to help quit drinking while stabilizing on subs. I was naturally pretty stumped considering they were all well aware that I had done my homework with the biochemistry of opiates and antagonists. I asked her, ""Wouldn't the neltrexone send me into precipitated WD considering it's an opiate agonist and counter the suboxone?"". She was adamant that natrexalone was the same drug in suboxone (she confused it with naxolone) and it didn't interfere with the buprenorphine binding to opiate receptors. I then tried to educate this nurse on the difference between the two opiate antagonists...that the naxolone was in suboxone purely to prevent IV abuse of the drug and had no oral bioavaliability like naltrexone...but she knew better apparently. I obviously ignored her misinformed advice, and when I ran it by the clinic doctor the next day, he laughed it off as her confusing campral with naltrexone like it was accidentally putting on odd socks. Man, I would have been in stitches with laughter had I not known better and taken my naltrexone on day 1 of my sub detox! Going into PWD while starting a detox taper...what a trivial, easy mistake to make as a detox medical professional :/

I've since completed a 16 day sub taper where I'm now due to collect my subs from a pharmacy. The nurse's last advice for me was that if I needed to go away for a few days, I was to ask the pharmacy to give me all the next three days doses all at once (since I can'tget takeaways yet). According to her, if you're stabilized on 4mg a day, taking 12mg will kick me over for four days just as well as staggering the regular doses. Given her last poor advice, I'm skeptical of this. They won't give me takeaways for a few weeks yet and I'm due to go away for work for 3 day next week. If I take 12mg, I'll be good till I return? It's fucking news to me and doesn't really make sense with the research I've done. Over-saturation of regular opiate doses just means increased opiate affects - the half-life shouldn't change and shouldn't affect the time it takes to go into WD, right? IF anything, a large dose might by me a few more hours of wellness, but suboxone doesn't 'stack' in the sense that higher doses will keep the receptor saturated to the exact ratio of dose to tolerance, right?

Seems like more bullshit, misinformed and risky advice from medical practitioners who are supposed to specialize in drug detoxing. Has anyone heard of this dose stacking with subs? If that'sthe case, couldn't everyone on a 4mg maintenance plan just take 32mg and be good for 8 days?

TL;DR my practitioner nurse in detox said if I need to go away from town for a few days, the pharmacy will let me take 3 days of standard sub doses all at once and that will work just as well as staggering the daily doses. I don't buy it. I think it'll just get me sub-stoned, probably up my tolerance temporarily, and I'll be in WD by the end of day two.

According to her, if you're stabilized on 4mg a day, taking 12mg will kick me over for four days just as well as staggering the regular doses. Given her last poor advice, I'm skeptical of this. They won't give me takeaways for a few weeks yet and I'm due to go away for work for 3 day next week. If I take 12mg, I'll be good till I return? It's fucking news to me and doesn't really make sense with the research I've done. Over-saturation of regular opiate doses just means increased opiate affects - the half-life shouldn't change and shouldn't affect the time it takes to go into WD, right? IF anything, a large dose might by me a few more hours of wellness, but suboxone doesn't 'stack' in the sense that higher doses will keep the receptor saturated to the exact ratio of dose to tolerance, right?

Seems like more bullshit, misinformed and risky advice from medical practitioners who are supposed to specialize in drug detoxing. Has anyone heard of this dose stacking with subs? If that'sthe case, couldn't everyone on a 4mg maintenance plan just take 32mg and be good for 8 days?

TL;DR my practitioner nurse in detox said if I need to go away from town for a few days, the pharmacy will let me take 3 days of standard sub doses all at once and that will work just as well as staggering the daily doses. I don't buy it. I think it'll just get me sub-stoned, probably up my tolerance temporarily, and I'll be in WD by the end of day two. Basically counter-active to everything I'm trying to get out of sub maintenance.",1.0,had one maybe two weeks sober. I have substantial,,,,

Please help me use this weekend to get a jump on facing WDs and recovering.,"Ever since I started using, I have always tried to control my habit; convincing myself I was in control if I was always using a dose small enough to taper down from pretty easily.

Every once in a while I would get sick of everything associated with using, but was always able to rationalize going back to that small amount; just enough to not feel awful, but not too much that I lose control.

I don't know when I fully admitted to myself I was an addict, but for some reason that fact didn't really matter to me. 

Anyway, one new really annoying aspect of what I feel my addiction has done to me is unravel this anxiety and paralysis. Everyone here probably knows it to some extent; every single decision, no matter how small, takes a really uncomfortably long time. Even just deciding what words to say to someone in a conversation. I will just get stuck and locked into a silence where it's like my brain just gives up searching for something to say and gives in to my indecision and produces awkward silences that make me cringe. I'm self aware enough to know it happens but not in control enough to jump in and stop it. I feel like a bystander looking down at my most fucked up self.

Anyway, the reason I even brought that up is because every time I start writing anything these days, it takes hours. Whether it's a couple sentences or an essay. So hopefully all these new insights and hopefully genuine urges to actually be clean are true.

Since I know my addict mind can't always be trusted, I have to rely on external facts of change or progress toward turning my life around. One of them is that in the past month, I have been coming to this sub more and more, and opiates less and less. I feel like I'm still very weak, but part of me wants to quit to avoid the depression and anxiety I have induced into myself after 5 years of poisoning my body and mind.

But anyway.... here's where I am EXACTLY right now: I take ~3mg suboxone/day and have been for a while now. Unfortunately my job has become a source of stress and anger and everything that being sober exacerbates, and that has driven me to occasionally allow myself a ""high vacation"" every few weeks. 

Last night I started one of these little vacations, using about 1mg total sublingual fent over the course of the night. Now here I am, with the weekend ahead of me. I have more fent, but I also have 5 full 8mg strips of suboxone, about 3-4 8mg subutex pills (they're all broken up so hard to tell exactly how much), and pretty much every possible other aid I could use to help get clean. Clonidine, benzos, weed, stool softener (dear lord do I need to take a shit!), lope (which I think I'll hold off on due to previous item on the list), a couple other related drugs (soma; not sure if that's helpful or just pure trouble in terms of trying to use it as a kind of lesser evil substitute for opioids since I have a pretty low tolerance to them and get a benzo type spaghetti legs goofy sensation from it. But the most important thing is this growing feeling that I genuinely want to stop.

So I have all these tools, mainly desire to start turning my life around and 2 precious weekend days. I just took about .5mg suboxone after waking up in WD from the fent (not horrible but damn is that half life short). So given all these tools and my mindset, I have no excuse for not being able to at least try to really face my addiction head on and try to fight.

Despite all these tools I have that can help me stop, it's obviously never enough. So I guess what I'm looking for are ideas on how to best use this weekend to my advantage. I took a small amount of benzo, soma, and (after trying to decide whether I should), a very small amount of suboxone. Given all these things, if you can take all these variables and either think of how to use them in combination the best way and make the most possible progress this weekend would be awesome. Both ideas and support from people who I know understand what I'm going through. 

To be specific, here's two things I'm trying to find: 1) an activity or adventure or hobby that will help fill the depression that will set in soon (I'm inclined to play video games and watch TV but I need a better plan). Yesterday, on an impulse I set a daily event on my phone to remind me to either spend some time either exercising, writing, meditating, or anything similar to that. If I can stick to that and just try to embrace more therapeutic and healthy activities that could really help. I also am trying to figure out how to use the arsenal of WD fighting drugs listed above. So I guess any activities or plans you can recommend to me given these parameters I have provided to help me maximize on this weekend to make some progress (or at least start that process if it will be a long one). I will likely come back here and add other details and context to my situation to both help you guys think of ideas (both for my and y9ourselves) to use this weekend to start firing away at my addiction and freeing myself of it.

Thanks in advance for any ideas or combinations of these tools I have at my disposal I can use to maximize my progress in this weekend. Again, I rambled way more than I wanted, but hopefully this is somewhat coherent, and if people think they may have advice for me but feel like they need more variables about my situation, I will try to provide as many as I feel comfortable providing.

I do have one big problem though that's really been getting on my nerves and I kind of just need to rant while possibly looking for a good suggestion on how to handle it.

I'll admit, most of my clean time so far was spent in jail (about 5 and a half months) the last month and a half I have been in a half way house. For me, strangely enough, this is something that I actually wanted to do. Maybe not exactly what I was looking for but I do know that I needed some sort of structure in my life that the half way house has been able to provide for me. When I went to jail back in June last year, it was sort of by my own choice. I was heavily using and tried to get clean on my own and just just couldn't do it. I knew that I had a warrant out for absconding from my PO and finally decided to turn myself in as an attempt to take myself out of my environment and get clean. Anyways, now back to today. Being in a half way house, almost everyone else there was pretty much forced into sobriety. Most of them don't want to stay clean and at least admit it that they are just there to satisfy their PO's and stay out of jail. Out of a house with 15 guys, I have one other person there that I can actually consider a friend because like myself, he actually wants to stay clean this time around (There may be another one now that just moved in this week but I haven't really gotten to know him that well yet.) So now, out of the other 12 or 13 guys... at least 3 of them are actively using H, a 4th just went back to jail yesterday for using. At least 3 are actively drinking. And there is at least 1 that is selling H and who knows what else on the street as well as to the others users in the house.

For me I can honestly say that it's not much of a trigger for me seeing these guys all fucked up laying around the house. If anything, it's more of a motivation for me that shows me why I don't want to use any longer. The thing that does really piss me off about it all though is that these guys consistently are getting away with it. The guy selling the dope is just a complete ass hole to begin with that I try to avoid but he keeps trying to sell me dope as well. He is also one of the first guys to talk to any of the new opiate addicts trying to get them high again. He is an all around bad influence on the house in my eyes.

The other day, I was the only one in the living room watching TV when the house manager is doing her walk through. On the floor right in front of me she finds half an 8mg Suboxone strip. She stopped, pointed at it and asked me if I knew what it was. I was honest with her and told her, ""Yes, it's half a Sub strip. But I have no idea where it came from."" They ended up dropping UA's on the whole house, which is when the one dude went to jail for a dirty UA. I don't think they ever found anyone that dropped dirty for subs.

So now this is my problem. Personally, I feel like it looks bad on me that the staff found that strip right in front of me and that now other people's use really is starting to affect the staff's view on me. I haven't really done anything wrong in the time that I've been there and I really do try hard to do what's asked of me. I have been going through all of the in house treatment programs, outpatient programs, as well as AA/NA meetings. Yet just because of this incident, I feel that I have been targeted. Everyone using in front of me is really starting to piss me off. It's come to a point where I really don't want to be that guy but I am almost really tempted to finally say something to staff about what's going on. After getting questioned about the Suboxone, I feel like the staff knows that I know what's going on and is annoyed that I won't say anything. I've never been a person to snitch on others especially since none of it has been directly affecting my recovery.

I'll admit, most of my clean time so far was spent in jail (about 5 and a half months) the last month and a half I have been in a half way house.

Again, it's been a while since I've posted, because of relapsing. Yesterday something happened that was NOT FUCKING COOL and I have to get this out there. It''s the worst plaec my addiction has brought me this far. (And my addiction I mean addicted self)
First of all, thank god that I'm not physically addicted to Opiates or this would be much harder than it is.  With that in mind, this is NOT a war story, this is being pathetic and low at it's finest. I got some random check in the mail Friday and all of a sudden I had a large chunk of cash.

THEN, I thought it would be better to buy a bunch more for the next day because why not rght (STUPID ADDICT THINKING). So, I get the pills and I get pulled over and my paranoid rationale says TAKE THEM ALL SO YOU WON'T GO TO JAIL.  

Here is the warning trigger. That would bring me up to 34 30's in 24 hours. That's disgusting. DISGUSTING. I knew I wouldn't survive taking 10 at once in my position. I drove to the nearest hospital and fucking told them that TRUTH.So I got Narcanned. At this point, I was responsive and fully lucid before I received Narcan. I thought it would harmlessly remove opiates from my system and obviously change my state from high to normal. HOLY FUCK I WAS NOT READY. They didn't warn me. Maybe I'm a baby but that was the worst feeling I've ever had. It started to get better like 15 minutes in. It reached several levels of better before comfortable, and another couple hours to regain my strength back. Then I woke up this morning (thank god), and am dealing with this situation. I AM USING THIS SITUATION TO STAY CLEAN THIS TIME. Follow the plan I had.

A little update to my previous post https://m.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/3vkzuy/hi_im_new_here_need_some_advice/

So I told all parties involved with my opiate theft. It was a tough day to be sure, but I'm incredibly lucky I have such a great support system. We realized that it's less about the high for me and more about my self esteem issues. I'm 24, and even though I'm almost done with school and have an amazing girlfriend, there is a lot I don't like about myself. It was easier to find opiates and let it numb me to my constant self put-downs than try and change them. I saw a therapist but it seemed like he did more of the talking than I did. I got more out of talking to my family than him.

I'm drug free for about a week. The only side effect I have is anxiety. It's the third time this has happened so I know what to expect, that doesn't make it any easier. I keep telling myself that this anxiety will go away, I saw my doctor and got my Buspar changed from 5 milligrams twice a day to 7.5 twice a day.

3 feb: 1mg/day

9 feb: .5mg (i did this to see if i could slide into the withdrawal, rather than crash)

10 feb: jump off (and, i think, my new clean date*)

not sure i recommend this; however, the relapse necessitated it. suboxone no longer felt safe as a tool for recovery. they wanted me to go from 4 straight to zero and just come into the detox facility each day, but i had too much going on at work. this caused me to go through a bit of withdrawal after the jump from 4 to 2, a bit more from 2 to 1, and real unpleasantness upon cessation. 

i'll update in the AM about how i feel. day three today has been pretty okay. i did an hour of hatha yoga that totally did me in. no regrets, though. however, based on feedback from /u/zuesk134, i'm a bit concerned about the coming days :)

I also went cold turkey off a binge of about 50 valiums as well which I forgot.  So I switched to kratom at day 11, it helped, but I found the stimulant properties at the end of the high would throw me into full blown panic attack.  I went to the ER again last night, basically in shock.  I explained to them my entire using situation and when I quit, had another ekg done (fear of heart issues from high dose loperamide for the past 4 months when I didn't have heroin or fentanyl and my use got really outta control) and they also ran blood tests, did a xray of my heart, and a toxiocology report.  I was honest to the docs about all my drug usage, and when I got clean and I was just terrified of dieing but all I want in the world is to be done with drugs.  I also was using about 1mg etizolam for the past year, and had another 50 valium 10mg bender a few months back.  Cardiologist was amazing, spent a bunch of time studying the ekg and couldn't see any issues with my heart.  But it has become evident I'm dependent on benzos, as a few days without, is when I start really freaking out and feeling like passing out and when I was combining highdose loperamide with my final few valium, there were times I would wake up completely white as if my heart had stopped, shaking uncontrollably sweating.  It also makes sense why the more loperamide I was using, the worst my symptoms seem to get.  I am so much more depent on benzos then I thought.  Anyways, the ER cardiologist prescribed me a few days worth of clonidine .1mg, twice a day, as well as 10mg valium x 2 for today, and 3x valium 5mg for tomorrow, and recommend I book an appointment with my family doctor (which I did, for tomorrow) to continue a safe and controlled taper off the benzo dependance.  

My brother who I only just came clean to about my addiction a few days back when I went to the ER again because I thought my heart was gonna stop, has been my absolute rock.  He controls the meds so I don't even have to think about not using them as prescribed.  I'm feeling much better today, took 3 long hot showers through the day, massaging my legs to help that pesky RLS.

Overall, I'm feeling so much better.  The clonidine helped so much because my blood pressure was sky high, and I was also apparently very dehydrated which makes sense why my heart felt truly like I was going to have a heart attack or it was gonna stop, and on top of almost cold turkey opiate withdrawal and benzo withdrawal, yea, wasn't feeling well.

Feeling much better today, I have been eating extra healthy, lots of water, fruits, vegtables, chamomile tea, healthy yogurt.  I'm still not shitting that regularly yet, I'm assuming its the massive amount of loperamide still built up in my system, but I've been taking a stool sofenter to help.

Honestly, the thought of using again repulses me, and I am feeling so much better today, again the clonidine seriously settled my hyperactive brain / cardiovascular system down big time, as well as allows me to catch some sleep, makes me much more calmer,  I'd say much more then the 10mg valium dose I took this morning.

I will make sure I only use the clonidine for a short period though, I don't want to trick myself into another addiction.

Anyways, some of my color is coming back, my energy, the clarity in my though, I'm so damn happy to be clean, to have told my family about my addiction and be honest with them, to not have this big secret on my back anymore, and to not be thinking about my next fix.  Best decision I ever made, and when I decided to get clean, I truly thought I might not make it (pain on the left side of my chest, my upper left arm, and up left back, but really this is just attributed to crazy high anxiety levels right now and my heart working extra heard) because my hypochondriac mind always assumes the worst lol.

I also was using about 1mg etizolam for the past year, and had another 50 valium 10mg bender a few months back.  Cardiologist was amazing, spent a bunch of time studying the ekg and couldn't see any issues with my heart.  But it has become evident I'm dependent on benzos, as a few days without, is when I start really freaking out and feeling like passing out and when I was combining highdose loperamide with my final few valium, there were times I would wake up completely white as if my heart had stopped, shaking uncontrollably sweating.  It also makes sense why the more loperamide I was using, the worst my symptoms seem to get.  I am so much more depent on benzos then I thought.  Anyways, the ER cardiologist prescribed me a few days worth of clonidine .1mg, twice a day, as well as 10mg valium x 2 for today, and 3x valium 5mg for tomorrow, and recommend I book an appointment with my family doctor (which I did, for tomorrow) to continue a safe and controlled taper off the benzo dependance.  

My brother who I only just came clean to about my addiction a few days back when I went to the ER again because I thought my heart was gonna stop, has been my absolute rock.  He controls the meds so I don't even have to think about not using them as prescribed.  I'm feeling much better today, took 3 long hot showers through the day, massaging my legs to help that pesky RLS.

Overall, I'm feeling so much better.  The clonidine helped so much because my blood pressure was sky high, and I was also apparently very dehydrated which makes sense why my heart felt truly like I was going to have a heart attack or it was gonna stop, and on top of almost cold turkey opiate withdrawal and benzo withdrawal, yea, wasn't feeling well.

Feeling much better today, I have been eating extra healthy, lots of water, fruits, vegtables, chamomile tea, healthy yogurt.  I'm still not shitting that regularly yet, I'm assuming its the massive amount of loperamide still built up in my system, but I've been taking a stool sofenter to help.

Honestly, the thought of using again repulses me, and I am feeling so much better today, again the clonidine seriously settled my hyperactive brain / cardiovascular system down big time, as well as allows me to catch some sleep, makes me much more calmer,  I'd say much more then the 10mg valium dose I took this morning.

I will make sure I only use the clonidine for a short period though, I don't want to trick myself into another addiction.

Anyways, some of my color is coming back, my energy, the clarity in my though, I'm so damn happy to be clean, to have told my family about my addiction and be honest with them, to not have this big secret on my back anymore, and to not be thinking about my next fix.  Best decision I ever made, and when I decided to get clean, I truly thought I might not make it (pain on the left side of my chest, my upper left arm, and up left back, but really this is just attributed to crazy high anxiety levels right now and my heart working extra heard) because my hypochondriac mind always assumes the worst lol.

Anyways, keep being awesome everyone, stay clean, live life :) ",1.0,"walking out before I relapsed.

Lastly I think sub's are definitely the right call for me. After the first few weeks I won't have to go daily to pick up methadone and its also going to male it doubly hard to use and feel anything. Does anyone think Methadone is the better choice? If so, why?

Yeah, mold toxicity.  It exists.  And it got me real good.
Tramadol was the only thing that helped.  Knocked that shit right out.
I was told by a Pain Doc that Tramadol was good because it was non-addictive.
Ha.
I don't do other drugs, with the exception of Klonopin which I take for dizziness.  Its mild anxiety relief does only a little good.  I keep my dose to .5mg a day.  Sometimes I don't even take it; it just depends on the dizziness.

So my new doc and I decided to wean me off Tramadol.  It had become a crutch.  Sure, I still get the migraines on occasion, and Tramadol helps the best, but it's not like it used to be.
Still, 300 MG of Tramadol a day now.  That's not a small amount.  It didn't start that way: a manageable 50mg to prevent migraines.
Three years later...

So my m.d. gave me a tapering schedule.  Couldn't do it.  Reminded me of when I tried to stop smoking ten years ago.  I smoked  a pack a day.  Cutting back to 18 a day was a useless exercise is self-flagellation.  I'd make it to maybe 1/2 a pack a day for a few days and then be back to a pack again within a week.  Tried to quit cold turkey three times before it stuck.
I have no intention of trying three times with Tramadol.
This is a one and done for me.

So on Sunday, June 14th, 2015 at 3pm I took my last dose.  Of course Sunday was easy as the beautiful drug flowed through my body like mushrooms through cow shit.
Sunday night came along and I slept like a...well, like a 38 year year old man sleeps: restless and out of sorts.  But nothing big.
Monday at 3pm:  I wrote in my calendar ""1 Day.""  It felt good, but I knew it was really just beginning.
Emailed my doc, told her I was cutting cold.  Ask her for advice.  She said she'd research and get back to me.  She did, during our last visit when we discussed weaning, say to pick up some L tryptophan for sleep.  So I did.
I use it like it says on the bottle, 3 times a day for calm and at night for sleeplessness.
Last night it all began.

I took my L Trypto and a Klonopin (street name clonazepam).  Slipped it under my tongue so it'd work faster.  Was asleep in a few minutes.  Monday hadn't been too bad, other than the paranoia of what might come.

Monday, 3am:  I wake up, body hot.  Turning in bed my legs feel like they need to be running up a mountain.  Fan not helping.  Turning and turning and sweating for another 30 minutes and I'm up.
My six year old has a new bed. It's got the works.  Arrived yesterday.  She's at her mom's tonight.  So I get to work.
This fucking thing is a bunk bed with a slide attached to it and a giant tent covering the ground.  Made of metal.  Tiny screws everywhere.  It's a god damn nightmare.
My cat keeps coming in to see what I'm doing. She's giving me looks.  I'm wondering if it's the Tramadol.  Or maybe she's just hungry.
The sun slowly pops open her eyes as I'm finishing up the bed.  This fucker took three hours and many cuss words to complete.  Didn't help that I was so tired.  But focused.   Hot flashes were gone, legs didn't feel restless.  Just man and his tools in the night.
Sounds like a porn.

Woke up late to class this morning.  I'm a grad student.  Fuck it I'm not going in.  Six hours until 3pm.  That will be the 48 hour mark.

She was mad. She is a stepmother to two teenagers that live in the house. And said, ""you can't live here if you keep using. You just need to stop.""

My Personal Experience","So here it is, the suboxone ""review"" per se that I have been meaning to post on here for about two months now. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom for you guys's convenience then. 

Stage set- Backstory 
It's October of 2013 and I have just relapsed after a year of clean time (entirely substance free). I start reverting back to all of my old addict ways. Fast forward 3 months and I'm already sick and tired of it all over again. My relationships (Especially that with my girlfriend at the time) are all strained at all ends. 

I want out, I want out so badly, but I don't have the ""Luxury"" of being thrown into jail unexpectedly like last time, no way to get that clean time under my belt again, so I decide it's time to check into a clinic. 
Suboxone was my choice for a couple reasons. 
1- I enjoyed Methadone, and I knew that I would abuse it given the chance.
2-The opiate blocker was definitely something I wanted, knowing that (again at least with methadone) I would push the envelope. 
and 3- A clinic was close, and I was easily accepted into it.

I somehow made it about 5 or 6 days with no use, after confessing to my family that I had relapsed, I had their full support. 
I went to the appointment, and they advised that I start out on a WHOLE 2 strips. This was insanity to me (I was only on a 60 to 90mg a day oxy habit, snorted) and I explained that I would like to start on a VERY low dosage, 2 mg is what I told them. 
I took my first dosage as I got home and shortly after, relief flowed through my body. I caught a slight buzz, which wasn't all that appealing, but the fact that I no longer craved, and every other symptom of having been an addict instantly disappeared seemed AMAZING to me! It felt like an absolute God-send! 

About a week later I asked to be upped to 4mg a day, and a couple months after that, I asked for 8mg a day. I found that cravings had made their way through, and I felt that I needed to put a stop to this and that this was the proper way at the time. I felt invincible. I felt no need for any other form of help. As long as I took the miracle drug I didn't need to do anything else. 

Looking back now, and even during the process of getting out of it, I see so many things wrong with so much. A lot of it came to light to me, when my girlfriend of almost 2 years ended it for good. 

See, although Suboxone had most definitely stopped the cravings, and the shitty feelings of PAWS (Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms) I never began to heal. It became more and more apparent to me, that I was still the exact same person that I was while using pills, except I didn't need to Lie, Cheat, or Steal. I was still a short fuse, I was still irrational at times for no reason, I was still the same asshole that I came to detest, and that I wanted to change from. 
That isn't solely based on my relationship with my ex either, ALL of my relationships suffered over time. 

Now the second awful, awful thing that I found about suboxone while trying to get off was this. The Detox. The dreaded suboxone withdrawals. 
As I was getting off, I tapered over the course of ""About"" 3 months. A little bit sooner. 
I had initially been trying to take a mg off every two weeks or so, but that proved very painful for me around the 3mg mark, and was taking far too long for my taste. 
I wont bore you with how I tapered, but needless to say, it was hell. 
In my personal opinion, the withdrawals from Suboxone were worse than anything I had ever experienced in my pill usage. 
Even stopping taking it, weaned all the way down to .25mg was hell. 
The ONLY thing that was easier about it than pill withdrawal was the fact that I didn't crave it. It was never something I enjoyed.

So I weaned off completely, and when I did, I quickly relapsed..
I started taking pills again to combat the withdrawals (Or so I told myself) from the subs.
As of tomorrow, I am checking into an inpatient rehab facility to start being clean again the right way.
Thanks for reading guys, thoughts, opinions, etc are all welcome and encouraged!

Now, OP means something different to me. My microwave is hardly ever used. 80 dollars can actually be used for quite a bit. The sifter in my kitchen only gets used occasionally for cooking.

noun


excessive, self-absorbed unhappiness over one's own troubles.


When bad things happen, it is normal to get depressed. it is normal to feel out of control and sit in those bad feelings for awhile.  It  is normal to vent.  However when we allow those negative events to take control of us, we become completely self absorbed.  we block any avenue of help.  we become completely selfish.  this is the modus operandi of addiction - to be only concerned about our lives, the effects of drugs in our lives, the ""finding, and getting and using more"", believing we have it worse than anyone that has ever lived,  believing we are unique in this situation &amp; nothing will work for us.  these feelings are addiction.  these feelings are just feelings and have not shackled the wrists and ankles of your life to misery.  *you* are doing that.


we get depressed, we can't see a way out, we think our lives are worth nothing, we think it is hopeless, we think there is nothing, that we are nothing.


i am here to tell you this isn't true.  there are examples all around you. Examples of people who have felt and been exactly where you are and found a way out.  and where is the path to out?  it is through acceptance and stepping forward through the pain until that pain fades.


bad things happen to all of us - horrible things, unthinkable things.   the only way out of the hopelessness is to believe that it is possible to be happy again, to be fulfilled again, and begin walking towards that.  no matter how slow or fast, no matter how much our brain tells us to stop.  we *have* to accept there is something better.


focusing on the negative, pulling resentments and bitterness along with us isn't going to get us out.  it is like holding onto an anvil while we are drowning.   only letting go of that shit and believing that one day we can achieve a life that is worth living will get us out.  


Recovery doesn't happen quickly.  It doesn't happen the way you want it to happen.  Life isn't going to realize that you have made a choice to make your life better and clear the path for you.  *you* have to do that for yourself.  *you* have to decide that you want a better life for yourself.  *you* have to want to work for it and go through everything that entails.


No, being strung out is not the end of the world.  Hell, OD'ing is the end of one world, but hardly effects the bigger picture. it is a sad fact, but it is true.  the world doesn't give a rats ass if you are happy.  *you* are the only one that should care.  And if you care, you should start stepping towards it.


Self pity is going to kill you.  Just like the drugs.  self pity will make you ignore all the brilliant things around you.  self pity will make you ignore all the help around you and make you think you are not worth it or that it can't possibly help you because you are so goddamn unique.  self pity will rob you of hope and happiness.  self pity is caused by you and you can decide to not feel sorry for yourself.  it is a choice.  choose life.",False,3ng1a2,,0,,False,1450753964,False,self,t5_2tkk8,False,,,False,True,,/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/3ng1a2/self_pity_is_a_choice/,t3_3ng1a2,,False,,,"Self Pity is a Choiceself-pit·y

It's a small glimpse of where I was and am now...and words that may help anyone. A buddy and I talked tonight for the first time since both getting help about everything we'd been through. We went to school together...were football teammates...just never close friends. I moved about an hour away after graduating but we were friends on Facebook. We later discovered we had alot in common (a pain pill addiction..had both had a major back surgery recently...and plenty of outside-the-doctors-office hookups as well.) While talking with him and just letting the typing flow without trying to come up with brilliant book material, It felt good as the words came out...and when I reread what I had said after sending it..it felt very powerful and amazing to see how distorted my thinking was and how clear it's become. Hope it helps.

**My Addiction Backstory** I've never posted on this sub. I've never been big on 12 steps, AA, or other common avenues as a source of therapy for my addiction. I still to this day don't really feel like discussing my addiction with others necessarily helps me. But these things do work for other people so I definitely refuse to knock it.  I will say hearing other people's stories and experiences did help me get through rehab...and continue think about from time to time throughout my journey. Maybe that's why I subscribed here.....to hear the stories and maybe even to keep an extra layer of protection on my shield in case I ever spiraled out of control. I won't go into all the things that led up to my addiction but share something quick about my life before it all happened as well as my downfall. My mom has been married 7 times. My dad was number 3. So I have had 4 step-dads throughout this point in my life (the last marriage starting right before my senior year). My moms life hadn't entirely fallen out at the time she divorced my dad when I was 5 years old...but she had shown her love for alcohol. Alcohol was and still is a common theme for that side of her family. She grew up in the apartment above the bar my grandma owned...so she already chips stacked against her. She was able to make a more financial stable life herself once she graduated and got away. Shes always been very intelligent but used it to manipulate and scheme her way through adulthood rather than earn it. I was her 3rd child but the only one she had with my dad..who by the way is a vet and did things the right way career wise when he left the service. He didn't know who he was getting involved with when he married my mom...and like all of her other marriages..she already had the new guy to move to when she made her divorce decision. Thanks to her playing the part so well, being on a personal level with court employes, and many judges almost automatically favoring women in custody hearings...she was awarded primary custody of me. I was to go to my fathers every other weekend. Again...4 times she was married between my ages of 5-17...a lot of moving around a school changes. Her alcohol addiction became more previlant and she became less functioning throughout my life. She had always been a pretty woman...so It wasn't surprising that her final two marriages were men with a lot of money. Having a job to help take care of me was no longer a concern for her. And eventually alcohol became prescription meds. **I'll stop there** just because even though she put me through A LOOOOT of things a kid shouldn't have to ever have to go through *(A preteen kid at the bar on multiple school nights a week so he could drive his mom home when the bar closed...a preteen waking up to a passed out mom carrying her to bed so he could ride 5 his bike 5 miles to school...even faking pain to get prescribed meds to give to her in my later years)* I don't contribute her decisions to me becoming addicted at all. I never noticed she had a problem for the lingest time because I was always provided for. Even the few times we were alone with just yus for months...I never saw a change in lifestyle. So why be concerned? And even when I did notice her dependency and that she raised me like shit...it only motivated me to **never** let myself become that type of person or parent. Also..my father has always been amazing...but again...powerless. He tried to get me away...but she had been a director for the chamber of commerce and so many other community positions that she was best friends with the people who had the real power. He is who my model myself after when it comes to raising my son...and I never let my addiction take my time from him...at least directly until it came crashing in. I didn't become so bad I would nod out. I didn't party or take the pills when it would just be him and I. I never let that kid go a day without play time or talking with daddy. So as a parent with an addict mom, I didn't let it get to that point and was there for him. As a son, brother, friend, and the biggest of all...a husband...I absolutely let it get that far and fell flat on my fucking face. So...maybe my Mom played a part in me having no concern to use school as an academic pathway after 4th grade and more for my sports and social life...then dropping college after my first semester. Possibly for a shitty handling of relationships most of my life. And do accept that studies are now saying addiction is an actual disease in the brain.  But I let it happen.. I took every pill on my own and I accept full responsibility.

So...how did I become addicted? My first real taste of pain pills was from a foot surgery when I was around 20. After the first one...I noticed it numbed my pain like they said it would. But I wasn't told it would numb my cares too.. Along with increasing my enjoyment for any activities I was performing. I was already extremely outgoing..I had to be to constantly make new friends. I had always been the tallest kid... And was 6'4 going into my 6th grade year. Never had a problem with girls. The thought of having a drug that would make all this feel even easier never crossed my mind. So here was a magical new world for me. And I didn't plan to abuse them...no one ever does. It was after my pain was eventually gone but I still being prescribed them that I thought ""These make me have more fun with every day sitatuions. It be good to have them on hand. No harm being done."" I was starting to really get the ""taste"", but too naive to realize the damage that was being caused. And as many of the stories go...eventually you begin to fake the pain because you still enjoy them. And then a few become 5, 6, 7 etc. at a time because you're chasing the euphroria but you're 100% sure this isn't a drug problem. Just to be safe though.. I still I had to keep it a secret because I knew everyone would immediately be concerned, given everything that's happened with us. And what did they really know anyway? I wasn't my mom. I didn't NEED them. I wasn't using them to ""get high""... Only to really highlight my personality. I wasn't mooching off anyone. I had a good job..my own place...and my life relatively in order. Some people drink beers to wind down...I had these. I deserved this. 

Fast forward almost 4 years later. I'm turning my law enforcement job (it can happen to anyone) in to a career...was married to an awesome girl who had a great job as well. And the best part of it all was my precious baby boy was on the way...one that we were told wasn't going to be possible to conceive due to some medical complications that my wife had. But it happened anyway. 25 year old me...the one who thought he was going to just melt into liquid because he got the phone call saying his wife (GF at the time) was pregnant and he thought his life was destroyed...was becoming a father. Fear almost immediately became excitement...and if anything negative was remotely in my head by now...it left the second I first held him in my arms. I always thought I knew what absolute raw true love felt like...and I wasn't even close. Nothing could ever bring me back down to earth...or so I thought. 

My back had become a serious bugging issue around this point. I hadn't had much pain since it first started with a blind side hit my junior year of football. But years of ""I can do anything without consequence"" can and did hit me like a ton of bricks suddenly. So therapy and pain pills (Aha!) were the solution given. I laugh...but I also really don't blame the doctors..if at all. It wasnt like pills were the only thing they were doing for me. They were trying shots and PT in every possible form too. Plus.. between my actual pain as well as learning the game of manipulating from my mom ever needed it... They couldn't have known. They even started with tramadol.. But I had a seizure (they thought it was an allergic reaction.. No one really knew I had taken 8.. So I got lots of 10mg hydro) A job related injury (legit and sober) finished it off. Now... a year after my son was born...I had a set surgery date for major back surgery just shy of 26 years old. My lower 2 disc had to be removed and a fusion of my spine to my pelvis... along with the rods and screws that come with it. I had been together with my now wife for 2 years and we had no out of the ordinary problems. We were both very happy. I still had my pain pill problem though. I knew it was a problem now. Like.. Multiple drs.. And any source of friends I could secretly give our hard earned money to for them kind of problem. 20 of the Hydrocodone 10/325mg(200mg Hydro/6500 mg of Tylenol) at **one time**... Multiple times a week kind of problem. Many people have turned to heroin by this point. I'm so thankful that.. Even at my worst withdrawal and dry spell point.. I would have never allowed myself to go there. I had already taken a desk job for a publishing company at this point so i didn't have to do anything physical and could ease into my job. The surgery happened... And the moment I woke up I realized my tolerance had basically laughed in the face of any meds they gave me. Even a morphine pump wasnt touching it. My entire stay at the hospital and recovery at home was anything but bearable. Add in the crippling effects of depression that I now had from serotonin levels no where near a normal productiodion (giving me an average of 1-2 inconsistent hours of sleep per night)... It really began to hit hard how fucked I was.

Fast forward 8 more months where I continued to abuse pain meds at an extreme rate. My wife... Friends.. And family was now completely on to me. I go into work like any normal day only to find out I was being terminated for lack of production. I found a different job as low paying corrections officer. My wife then says we need time apart and takes my son... The only thing that even made me smile anymore.. And stays at her mom's 30min away. I decide to end my life. I made all preparations and call my son for one last phone call. I reasoned with myself that he was only 2 and wouldn't remember me. I didn't realize i was on speaker phone crying saying my good byes. My wife realizes what I'm doing and keeps me on the phone while texting my buddy to get to the house asap. I had the loaded gun in my hand when he pulled up. I couldn't have him see me do that. I agreed to go to rehab. I was for the first time ever ready to change. I completed my rehab..24 days of uncertainty. And I nailed it! I took it seriously and began to have a clear mind again. My work even agreed to pay all cost and my paycheck. I was so excited to start my life over. Which is exactly what happened.. Because when I got out... We no longer had a house. The damage had been done and wife had been getting the divorce process started before I was even through detox. So here's what I wanted to share.. What set this all off. And I'll tell you quickly how I am now... Almost a year later.

**The Excerpt** *""I wish I would have had my eyes opened sooner...but thankful to still have my life and my son. Those are obviously the 2 most irreplaceable so I count my blessings. I probably always knew it would take some kind of extreme wake up call to ever stop. Addicted is addicted. And there is no over night change for an addict. The really shitty thing is..you and I..and every other addict no matter what their choice of drug...will always be addicted. We will always know in the back of our minds how great we felt when we had our drug. But it's remembering how temporary that satisfaction really was...and what we have left to lose that's permanent. We have to stay strong. We have to remember that the drug may have been great..but what we had to do to get it in our hand wasn't anything but worth it. Stressing out about doctors finding out you're seeing other doctors and possibly turning you into the police or even getting caught with what wasn't prescribed which is a felony per pill. Waiting anxiously on your plug to come through...every second lasting more like a minute...and every minute like an hour. Scrounging up money to buy them then going without buying anything of substance for yourself...including food. Driving hours away to buy it hoping you aren't getting set up..or driving pharmacy to pharmacy and sweating bullets they aren't on to you. The constant fucking paranoia because it's the ONLY fucking thing you ever thought about...at all. All while lying to everyone around you who has ever loved you in your life. The drug was our life 24/7...and work, relationships...and even fucking daily hygiene was a far away secondary concern. Fuck that shit. My thinking is so clear now.
And you're right that we may not be the closest of friends...but our addiction bond we have may be one of the strongest connections there is...stronger than a lot of friendships I've had in my life. I'm always here for you brother. It's corny as hell but became one of my favorite sayings I made up in rehab: **You will always have me to rely on and I'll forever remain undjudgmental...and though you may stumble...I'll make sure you never fall.** ""*

**Present Day** The divorce was finalized. My visitation rights are 100% her discretion. She has allowed every other weekend and split holidays. She's made it clear that any inclination of drug abuse and she will exicute her right to keep him away. And though I moved an hour away to take a job with my bro and get back on my feet...I haven't missed a weekend yet. He is right here next to me playing on his iPad... With a 3rd birthday this week. I will take every advantage I can to give him some amazing memories in his life.... Because he could very easily not have any memories of us at all. And just last week..I took a job opportunity and now live just 15 minutes from him. I'm in pain management because I still have alot of pain.  I was honest with him and am given 30 of the 7.5mg hydro a month for one at bed time.. With regular and random drug tests/pill counts... And Nueroton to help during the day. It hasn't all been easy.. Especially not seeing my son every day. But it helps keep me grounded. I hope there's something in my story and excerpt for everyone. You all now have my username.... So please contact me if you ever need anything.. Even to just talk about other topics. My old publishing employee is in talks with me to publish a full detail story of everything.. From my childhood to now. I know it wouldn't have much interest... But I think it be therapeutic for me and people close to me for a chance to really see my clear mind description of how things happened. I really do love my mom after everything. I experienced so much in my addiction for 6 years... So her suffering for almost 50 now is unfathomable. Also..Not many law enforcement step forward for rehab or ask for help.. And if they do it's usually in a very private setting. Mine wasn't private and definitely a unique experience for everyone involved. But I was accepted. Even if one person reads this..I really hope it helps. It's helped me. *I have stumbled... But i refuse to fall.*",False,4udi1s,,0,,False,1472984078,False,self,t5_2tkk8,False,,,False,True,,/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/4udi1s/something_short_that_i_think_anyone_currently/,t3_4udi1s,,False,,,"Something short that I think anyone (Currently using..In recovery..Impacted by an addict) should read. As well as my journey for those who feel like a longer read.**TL;** I'm on mobile so sorry about error. If you're here just to read the little bit I want you to hear....skip passed the long version of my back story and on down to the excerpt from a former addict and I's convo. It's a small glimpse of where I was and am now...and words that may help anyone. A buddy and I talked tonight for the first time since both getting help about everything we'd been through. We went to school together...were football teammates...just never close friends. I moved about an hour away after graduating but we were friends on Facebook. We later discovered we had alot in common (a pain pill addiction..had both had a major back surgery recently...and plenty of outside-the-doctors-office hookups as well.) While talking with him and just letting the typing flow without trying to come up with brilliant book material, It felt good as the words came out...and when I reread what I had said after sending it..it felt very powerful and amazing to see how distorted my thinking was and how clear it's become. Hope it helps.

**My Addiction Backstory** I've never posted on this sub. I've never been big on 12 steps, AA, or other common avenues as a source of therapy for my addiction. I still to this day don't really feel like discussing my addiction with others necessarily helps me. But these things do work for other people so I definitely refuse to knock it.  I will say hearing other people's stories and experiences did help me get through rehab...and continue think about from time to time throughout my journey. Maybe that's why I subscribed here.....to hear the stories and maybe even to keep an extra layer of protection on my shield in case I ever spiraled out of control. I won't go into all the things that led up to my addiction but share something quick about my life before it all happened as well as my downfall. My mom has been married 7 times. My dad was number 3. So I have had 4 step-dads throughout this point in my life (the last marriage starting right before my senior year).

I know with addiction sometimes we don't feel the best people, hell sometimes I still feel like the scum of the earth. But you guys are awesome. Keep reaching out. This shit saved my life. 

I know this post is kind of overly bubbly and self congratulatory... oh and also redundant because I write things like this a lot. But I don't care. I just wanted to point out that this is probably easily the most positive online community i've seen. 

Hope everyone enjoyed their weekends. Have a happy sober week!

I actually feel somewhat normal now and I have regained care and empathy that I thought was gone forever. I came across a few articles in the past few days of young adults who had died from overdose, and how it broke the hearts of their families. When I was using, I would've been completely unaffected and probably would've shot up not too long after reading it. But when I read those a few days ago, it actually made me feel terrible and I truly never wanted to touch an opiate again.

I'm blessed to be above the ground today.
I am almost through the steps and I graduate from my outpatient tomorrow, two major goals I had set early in my recovery.

Then my stupid mind thought i could chip and use every now and then. It probably only worked for half a year because I was only able to get 5 10mgs Percocet a week.

 Oh yea my DoC was always percs or hydros and 15-20mg a time. Sometimes i could get more so I would be able to use for 3 or 4 days a week. I did this for 2 years before officially quitting (attempting to at least). I never got any physical WDs, and i still do not. Maybe a little i dunno but i think its mostly mental. I then tried quitting at the beginning of the school semester and it fucked everything. I would use the pills as a reward system to get all my school shit done and once i did not have that i failed my first class. I then got depressed and after a couple months started using more. This is where it got bad. I found another guy and could get literally as many as I wanted for every day. I still kept my 20mg diet but slowly it didnt feel as good. Then i found 60s hydros which i would take over 2 days. This made my tolerance skyrocket to where I cannot afford the lifestyle nor even want it. I have kratom it helps but the mental boredness is too much sometimes. 

The semester just started ( I know worst time to try and quit again) but this time i made a plan. I still pick up (though half of what i was getting) and give them all to my gf. I tell her not to let me have them before a certain day (usually the weekend) and increase the amount of days in between.

About one year ago I decided to write a little narrative on my love affair with heroin, and it became the AMA/FAQ for heroin on this subreddit, as chosen by upvotes I suppose. I no longer visit this sub because honestly reading about drugs really has no place in my life if I'm going to be real with myself. But after reading the post I made last year and scrolling through the comments I saw that I had some positive feedback about the idea of a sober followup. I think what this followup will serve as, is a narrative of the ""other side"" of heroin use. There are a lot of drug users on this sub that use responsibly with little impact on their quality of life, and others that may really be heading down a rough road. Hopefully this can serve as *something* useful for both groups and anyone in between. 

I cant exactly recall the moment I realized I was addicted to heroin, but the sentiment that came with it was clear. I really can't keep using, and I really can't stop using. Fuck right? The thing to understand about addiction to any drug, but especially heroin and other opiates, is that it is very much like an abusive romantic relationship. I didn't just *like* to get high, I was *in love* with heroin. The comparison of dope to a shitty lover is a sort of tired analogy, especially in music, but for good reason I think. This vinegar scented mistress of mine would routinely burn down truly loving relationships, steal all of my possessions of value, steal *others* possessions of value. Ultimately, though, I'd come back. I'd get the same questions that a woman going back to a physically abusive man might get. *Why? Don't you see what it's done to you? Don't you care about me?* To their frustration my sickness had blinded me. For I was too smart to be an addict. I knew too much about chemicals and the brain to be susceptible to the demise that countless others have fallen into. Little did my narcissistic self know, that knowledge does not come packaged with immunity to situations I'm not only genetically predisposed to, but also diving head first into with my cockiness. 

Now I'm not one of those rare folks who just ""made some bad decisions"" and ended up physically dependent on opiates, only to detox and carry on drinking brews with his bros. There was a *reason* I used. I could list some acronyms for diagnosis that I've received that caused my unrest throughout my youth, but ultimately that won't paint the picture in a way that makes sense. Since I was young shit never seemed to be ""ok"". I was awful at sports, couldn't keep up with schoolwork despite my at least capable level of intelligence, and most maddeningly I just didn't really think I was *like* other kids. My thoughts would race, I would question my own existence, I always either thought I was superior to others or vastly inferior. Whether it was better or worse, I was never the same as anyone else. This is a huge cliche in AA/NA, but I felt like everyone else got the playbook on life and somehow the mailman missed my fuckin' house. Sure, I was bullied and all that shit, but I can't place the blame on that. It's always seemed that shit just didn't add up in my brain. I was angry. I was miserable. I was confused. This would probably sound like a vast majority of peoples younger years but for me I didn't grow out of it. The issues simply evolved, became intellectually ingrained in my being and my behaviors. High school came along and I got involved in an extremely fucked up relationship with a very mentally sick girl. I would ace every test, while barely scraping together 14% on homework. I got *obsessed* with drugs. Researching them, trying them, selling them. At first I thought I had found a secret little treasure that nobody else quite understood, at least not the way *I* did. Especially so with psychedelics. Then through places like this I found out I HAD found something special, but it wasn't just me- it was all sorts of young ""psychonauts"" like me all over the world. So cool, I found something I'm good at. That I can successfully ride on to feel part of something. I don't mean to discount the significance of LSD and the likes in my life, I certainly gained a lot from those experiences. Although over time it became a form of mental-masturbation if you will.  Anyway, I slowly started developing a very nihilist outlook on life. Everything was meaningless, every desire, passion, love, sensory input, decision- EVERYTHING- was just random white noise in a sea of more white noise. 
&gt; Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high. -Nas. 

I found opiates in this time. It was like I had been born with a poppy flower sized hole in my soul, and I had filled that bitch up. Filled it up real good. For my own sanity and to avoid redundancy, you can read about what opiates feel like to me in the Heroin AMA. Now that I had found the perceived answer to all my problems, things really changed. It was powdered *acceptance*. I was never able to accept my place in this world, my own shortcomings, my own truly powerful nature that all of us have. With one pill, one line, one shot- all that shit could be gone. Now tell me, what the fuck else was I to do with my life from that point on? I lied to myself. Because I wasn't stupid. Everyone knows heroin is the top dog when it comes to life-ruining.  Ultimately I didn't use for ""fun"", I used because I didn't have whatever it takes to put a gun to my head. However, I didn't really *know* that at the time of my early heroin use. I was blind to it. First, I was just going to use once. I actually used a needle my very first time, not very common and a very telling fact about my state of mind at the time. Secondly, I wasn't going to just use it once, but I definitely wasn't going to do it *every day*. Because THAT is when you're an addict right? I'm sure you can see where that is leading. 

Now fast forward to when this thing becomes a very obvious, all out addiction. At this point I've been to treatment more than once, tried being sober and eventually relapsing after around six to nine months. Things have really come to a head now, I'm waking up in agonizing withdrawal every day and I can't seem to ever have enough money so I'm doing some really ""out of character"" shit to get the sickness away. Now, if you've read about in the AMA or experienced an opiate high yourself, let me tell you about withdrawal. It's the exact evil twin of the high. A broken mirror image. NOTHING is ok, and absolutely nothing can satisfy you. It's an equally innate and primal feeling of need and discomfort as the high is acceptance and pleasure. When you lay down, you're too restless to stay there, and when you stand up you're too exhausted to stay up and moving. The worst part, once you're really unable to deny the nature of your predicament, is that you know you can make that feeling go away- you just have to let yourself, your friends, family, lover down again. Just call that man. Just pawn that laptop, yeah it's your moms but you'll just straighten that out and get her a new one once everything is okay! It'll be fine! Yeah, fuck it. I'm selling this laptop and once I get that shit in my veins I'll be okay and my life will start *then*. Of course, that ""then"" never comes. Once I got well the frantic feeling of withdrawal left me and honestly, not even the high, which lasted all of 30 minutes at this point, could hide the shame I felt for what I've become. People have said I'm smart. Wonderful girls have loved me. Why is *this* how my life is? FUCK!? Repeat this process daily until you either die, go to jail or become disgusted enough or in enough trouble to change something.

I'm clean for about 75 days today. So clearly, I have gone back out there since I last said I was clean in the comments of that AMA. I've finally been beaten into a place of reason. I'm taking advice now. I'm not assuming I know better than the people trying to help me anymore, because I fucking *don't*. All my best ideas got me to the place I described above. I'm not saying I'm useless, dumb or weak willed. I'm just kind of a sick person that found an even sicker cure, and it's going to take some serious work to bring myself to a place of less selfishness, narcissism, depression and an unmanageable life. If any of this hit a nerve with you I urge you to talk to somebody, you're not alone. It doesn't have to even be heroin, I know people who feel this way about cannabis. I'm open to any questions/comments/criticisms if anyone actually bothered to read all this shit. Much Love - NearJat

First time posting here but i've been lurking for a while and all the posts are absolutely inspirational to me!

So here's my story. I've been addicted to DHC (codeine,similar to Vicodin i think) for probably a couple of years now. Just before christmas I confessed all my to my wife and we went to the docs who put me on a long taper and everything was going ok until i messed up and took a couple more pills from my script than i was supposed to so i bought some more online with the intention of replacing the missing pills and flushing the rest or selling them for some cash (low i know) but as you guys can probably guess that didn't happen.  

I was so close, down to about 120mg a day but then i blew it all by buying some more then i starting just using all the time again and thats been going on since. I've had enough now and need and want to stop. The only problem is, my wife cannot know. If she finds out i've been using again she has confirmed to me that she will walk, i will lose her. And thats something i'm not prepared to do. 

So anyway, i've got maybe just over a weeks worth of pills left and my wife is going away next weekend from thursday night to monday. I am planning to quick taper this week and next week until next weekend when she goes away and i'm going to stop completely and cold turkey it over the weekend. I know it will last longer than three days but hopefully i'll be getting over the worst of it after those few days of cold turkey after a quickish taper? I work full time and Saturday mornings but hopefully can get next friday, saturday and sunday sunday off so i can withdraw. 

Basically I want you guys opinions on how is the best way to go about this. I have never had any problems with any other drugs or alcohol before and I understand this is small stuff to all you guys withdrawing from herion, Oxy ond other much harder stuff but you guys seem to be a great community and as I cant really talk to anyone about my problem  it would be great to have the support of this group. 

I have an decent supply of valium and xanax that i could use over that weekend and also a small amount of weed that could bring me some relief? Would love to hear what you guys have to say.

I typed out a huge post on my phone and it froze. That's life. Maybe it's for the better. I don't have a computer because I'm house sitting for a while.
Hope everyone is having a great weekend in recovery. Congrats Fml on getting back into iop.

Today is Day 24 and was a wonderful Saturday, filled with amazing weather (Denver) and good food.  It's really cool to re-live the experience of working a 40 hour work week and then the excitement of Friday and the approaching weekend.  This had been lost for years in my life, as all days would just bleed into a seemingly endless stretch of high highs and even lower lows.  

But I digress...

Work has been going good.  I can't stress the importance of a good schedule.  I know this advice is always thrown around, and I never took it too serious.  However, I now understand the tremendous benefits of said lifestyle.  One thing that I'm convinced has occurred as a direct result of my new ""9-5"" work schedule, is a solid, uninterrupted 6-7 hours of sleep each night.  To some, this won't sound like a big deal, to others with sleep issues like me, this will appear as amazing as it is.  In the evenings, I find myself both mentally and physically tired, too the point that I will start to doze off while watching TV past 8:30PM.

Some things I still need to work on are diet and smoking.  I have started smoking close to 5 cigarettes/day as a result of my new work schedule/lifestyle.  However, it is in no way necessary, nor conducive to my success at work, making it an easy thing to stamp out...Hopefully.

Today is Day 24 and was a wonderful Saturday, filled with amazing weather (Denver) and good food.  It's really cool to re-live the experience of working a 40 hour work week and then the excitement of Friday and the approaching weekend.  This had been lost for years in my life, as all days would just bleed into a seemingly endless stretch of high highs and even lower lows.  

But I digress...

Work has been going good.  I can't stress the importance of a good schedule.  I know this advice is always thrown around, and I never took it too serious.  However, I now understand the tremendous benefits of said lifestyle.  One thing that I'm convinced has occurred as a direct result of my new ""9-5"" work schedule, is a solid, uninterrupted 6-7 hours of sleep each night.  To some, this won't sound like a big deal, to others with sleep issues like me, this will appear as amazing as it is.  In the evenings, I find myself both mentally and physically tired, too the point that I will start to doze off while watching TV past 8:30PM.

Some things I still need to work on are diet and smoking.  I have started smoking close to 5 cigarettes/day as a result of my new work schedule/lifestyle.  However, it is in no way necessary, nor conducive to my success at work, making it an easy thing to stamp out...Hopefully.

Some would say so, but I'm glad I went out I had fun, won in beer pong and beat this dude who is talking to my ex in arm wrestling. I had to celebrate 2 weeks clean again some how, plus my buddy was having a baby tomorrow.

I turn 23 on Tuesday too, but I don't think I'll be doing anything. I don't feel like I deserve it.

She helped me kick and get clean but it wasn't long before I found a new hook and continued down the path of scoring then kicking,  then scoring then kicking, then trying to use kratom to maintain until I could score more. 

Well the norcos weren't doing the trick, so I found where to get percs. Well, those are just full of Tylenol so why not find some straight oxy.  When I first started I could spend $100 and be good for the week. Now I have to spend $300-400 every few days to keep it all going. 

So last night was the last of my opiates I've taken.  I'm still horribly addicted to weed.  I don't know what to do.  My girl and I have grown in the past year,  moved in together,  got new jobs,  our future's are looking bright. But I'm deathly afraid to tell her because I know she'll leave me.  

This all started because of my depression. I would drown my sorrows in a big old bowl of weed and just veg out on tv. The weed wasn't enough for some reason.  I started searching for hooks on pills because I knew they were around,  I just needed to ask who had them.  I finally found some one who sold and it was downhill from there.  I could get them any time, of any day of the week.  About 3-4 months later I saw the toll it was taking on my body and mind and came clean to my beautiful girlfriend.  

It was devastating to her.  And I didn't really realize why it effected her.  She told me about the horror stories she went through with addiction in her family and she couldn't go through that with me.  She forgave me but told me she would leave if it happened again. 

The next few months I worked on getting clean and I was clean for a couple months.  My old connect disappeared but I found a new player in the game but it wasn't as reliable.  So the past year I've been going in and out of trying to be sober and constantly relapsing. Before I landed my dream job I knew I should quit but they wanted me to start the next day.  I couldn't pass it up and for the past 8 weeks I've been high and living a lie at this new job.  They are all so wonderful and caring and worry that I'm sick.  But I feel like a piece of shit for abusing their kindness by lying to their faces.  They don't know me.  The sober me.   

So I'm stuck.  What do I do.  Come clean to my lady and possibly ruin my relationship? Or lie again about being sick and try to stay sober?  I don't want to score ever again but that's me whining about being sick.  I'm being honest.  I don't want to score but I also know that my pattern for the past year.  I'll get clean then relapse.

Especially with an addictive personality. I've been trying to find healthy and constructive ways to fill the void that my addiction has left. 

I never really noticed how much time I spent trying to pick up and getting high until I stopped using. What used to fill my time, some empty void in my mind, it almost killed me. It almost took away what was most precious to me- my family. So why am I homesick for a place that should never have been home? It's better than dopesick I tell myself, but with withdraws there was a resolution and a cure to fix the illness that settled deep into my bones. 

The only resolution for this homesick, or missing dope-dopesick, is time. Time. Time. Time. I am perpetually rushing, even with no where to go. Rushing through writing this, with nothing on my agenda to do after. Time heals all. Time helps you forget. Time helps you move on. 

But this time is overwhelming. There aren't enough hours in the day to run my errands, work, take care of my children- but time is not relative in my mind. That preoccupation that once lived in the four walls of my head- is now replaced with methods of trying to forget it. Trying to not want it. God awful memories and the guilt that tear me up inside. 

These times that I've had with my family through out my sobriety so far, the new memories I've made, the relationships I've strengthened- it's motivation. It's bliss. It's joy. It's everything I have ever wanted. 

I'm homesick for a place that I never want to visit again. It comes and it goes. I'd much rather feel homesick while resting in the embrace of Jeronimo while helping me through it, than to reside back at that home with out him. 


I'd much rather feel homesick than not be able to remember what I did yesterday. 

I'd much rather feel homesick than nod off while spending time with my children. 

Homesick for a home I never wanted. Homesick for a home I never want to visit. Homesick for a home too small to hold my family. I evicted myself from that hellhole, and I'm never fucking going back.

The H started out lightly too and even at my worst it was still only a bag a day (I'm sure that sounds like nothing to most of you) but when I would use for 4 or 5 days in a row I would get terrible anxiety and depression.  

I decided to to quit the drugs and drinking as well.  But when the anxiety didn't go away I went to a doctor and was put on an antidepressant.  That and talking to a counselor seemed to help.  I think it took a little over a week but the depression eventually lifted.  I made it the 30 days I wanted to go without drinking and when I started that back up the desire to do opiates wasn't too bad.

But one day a friend of mine offered me a few perks.  I was doing so well that I said, ""fuck it, why not"".  So I was back to using pain pills here and there, nothing big.  But then a couple months ago or so I decided to try H again.  And again it was light use, but then this weekend I used for 4 days in a row and I'm feeling the anxiety again.  I should mention that I stopped taking the antidepressants about a month ago.  I'm going to try stopping the H and going back on the antidepressant but I feel so stupid that I let this happen to myself again.  I should be 5 months clean but instead I'm only 1 day :-(

My only silver lining is I know that most people let it get a lot worse before they try to get clean.  I'm not having any physical withdraws (the only slight physical symptoms I'm feeling I think are brought on by the anxiety).  But mental pain can hurt a lot too.

They say that addiction and cravings get easier as time goes on...if that's the truth, than what the fuck is wrong with me.

I guess I should give my story before I get too much into it. I was arrested January 4th for possession and a DUI. I sat in jail until may 23rd because I took this thing called drug court and the judge wants you to sit in there for so long to clear out your mind and so you have enough time to decide whether or not you're actually ready for something like sobriety and drug court in general...It was actually a good thing for her to do this because I feel it cleared my mind tremendously before going to rehab.

Anyway, I got out May 23rd and went straight to an inpatient rehab for 70 days. I got out August 2nd and went to a halfway house that was close to my family and is also where I spent most of my time copping and doing dope.

I don't know if it's because I'm out of a controlled environment and in old familiar places, but it just seems this is getting harder and harder...in jail, i'd have cravings maybe once a month...but in rehab i was getting them maybe twice a week...they were getting so bad I was contemplating suicide. Now in the halfway house it's even more frequent...the suicidal thoughts come maybe once a week or once every two weeks, but the cravings are nearly everyday.

At the halfway house I'm at, you can see one parking lot where i'd ALWAYS cop dope and you can see another parking lot where I've OD'd and it's about two blocks away from one of my old dealer's house (he got clean though and doesn't sell anymore). But me and this guy who's been by my side since jail always go on walks and since i'm so familiar with this place ALL I can think about is drugs. I've also recently started school and it's so fucking weird being there while sober, especially when I go in the bathrooms because I'd always shoot up in there between classes.

I don't know where I'm going with this, maybe just looking for strength and hope, but how in the hell do I move past all of these obsessions? I go to 5 meetings a week and that doesn't really help, and I try to just ignore these thoughts, but sometimes that's just completely futile and it ends up being all I can think about. I can honestly say that if I weren't on drug court, I more than likely would have relapsed a LONG time ago, and that fucking scares me because I don't know what the hell is going to happen when I'm off of drug court either in March or September next year (depending on how quickly I can phase up). I always remind myself the ""one day at a time"" thing, but these are real problems...I just try to tell myself by next year, I will be making so much progress in my life that I won't want to go back to shooting dope.

I don't know...for those of you who are just beginning in this recovery thing, don't be discouraged by what I'm complaining about right now. Life in sobriety is absolutely amazing and it's extremely rewarding to know that I have REAL friends now who ACTUALLY care about me and aren't only friends with me because I have money or drugs...they love me for me and it's a great feeling. My confidence is at an all time high to the point where I don't lock myself and isolate myself all the time and I'm actually able to talk with people while still feeling a bit more comfortable than I normally would.

And I can tell already that school is going to be exponentially easier without having to manage addiction with my education. It's so nice not having to be in withdrawl during class or trying to force myself awake or constantly looking at the clock and I even have more motivation to do my homework...yesterday I even read the chapters I was supposed to! I normally would have just put it off.

The only thing I can say is that dealing with life on life's terms means you're going to have a lot of downs where you will want to give up, but life also has it's ups that makes life worth living sober even through those down moments.

Three weeks ago today my partner and I did heroin for the last time. We were using pretty heavily, on and off for almost two years (always smoked it, never mainlined). My partner had been doing it a lot longer.

This time we went through most of it cold turkey. We used some kratom, which worked well for my partner (the kratom just made me vomit, I'll have to try the capsules next time), and after about three days of withdrawal we were given a 12 mg suboxone strip, which we cut into 1 mg pieces, and made it last 2 or 3 days.

After we got through the worst of the withdrawal we both came down with a terrible flu that's going around our area. We got over that, then we were sick some more (It's almost like heroin abuse lowers your immune system or something)...

Anyway, today I woke up, at the crack of noon, after a wonderful nights sleep, with my partner safe in my arms, and for the first time in three weeks I feel as close to normal as I have in what feels like years. I've spent a lot of time feeling hopeless and depressed, but now the feeling of hope is real, and it has been ever since deciding to quit.

Still get occasional chills, and cravings are lame, but we're returning to our stoner roots. Weed has helped tremendously, but more than that we've been getting out there and reconnecting with all the people we alienated ourselves from with our drug use. Also we've both decided to live a more healthy lifestyle, we're working on being more active, despite the fact that we're really out of shape, which is really just all the more reason to get healthy.

Also meth is gross, it's not a good way to get through withdrawal, you'll be trading one drug for another. We've had it around us a lot lately and we're done with it, and most of the people that bring it with them.

It was like months felt like days. Days felt like hours. Sometimes I would barely be conscious for half the day. 

When I decided to get clean, 7 months ago, it felt like time came to a grinding halt. I could not believe how slow time was going. That first month I still remember so well. It felt like a fucking eternity. The next month was a lot better, but time was still going by slow. Now I can't believe that was 7 months ago. The past five months have flown by, and while i've had some tough times I have come through relatively unscathed. 

I got some good news today, so I am in a hell of a mood. What a huge contrast when I was feeling ready to die. So if anyone feels like that, as someone who has been through it, stick your chin up. THINGS WILL GET BETTER. There will be hard times again, but not the same as right now. Even though things may seem completely lost and hopeless, you will look back on how you handled this crisis in five years as a defining point in your life. 

No matter what we do in life, time passes the same. It may feel fast or slow, but 1 minute of doing something healthy will pass the same as 1 minute doing something unhealthy. How we deal with our lives, minute to minute defines us in the long run. Tomorrow I am going to try to seize the day and make it as productive as possible, so in the future I have a better life.

It was like months felt like days. Days felt like hours. Sometimes I would barely be conscious for half the day. 

When I decided to get clean, 7 months ago, it felt like time came to a grinding halt. I could not believe how slow time was going. That first month I still remember so well. It felt like a fucking eternity. The next month was a lot better, but time was still going by slow. Now I can't believe that was 7 months ago. The past five months have flown by, and while i've had some tough times I have come through relatively unscathed. 

I got some good news today, so I am in a hell of a mood. What a huge contrast when I was feeling ready to die. So if anyone feels like that, as someone who has been through it, stick your chin up.

Like a long winding road, it's late at night and downpouring. The leafs stick to the street and cause your tires to slip like black ice. You come to a two way intersection. Which one do you take?


The left turn is a long narrow road. There are no cars on it, empty homes with boarded up windows, it's dreary. You've been here before. Your only company was your depression, your struggles, and your inevitable demise. You lost your loved ones. You are alone. The empty houses are all locked, there's no way in to shelter from the rain. The further you get down this road the narrower your path gets. The pavement, cracked. With each step you feel your body begin to shut down. You see a dim light down at what seems a million miles away. Yet you will never reach it. You will walk forever. 

The right turn, is a two lane street. Sidewalks lined with daisies. Each home filled with beautiful families. Dogs in each yard guarding white picket fences. You have not been here in a very long time. The smell of the air is crisp and warm. You hear a call in the distance and turn around. Down the street is your family, your friends, your job, your goals, your hopes... it's all in reach. But there are many stops on the way to them. Each one seems impossible to conquer, yet you see the light at the end of the tunnel. You persevere. You follow through.


My point is that you can not have it both ways in addiction. You can not have the best of both worlds.  For every ounce of energy you put into fueling your addiction, you take away from something else. Your children, you significant other, your career.. Eventually there will be nothing left of them. Your addiction would've consumed all energy. The glutinous disgusting being would have been the largest thing in your life. 


Many times I have taken that left turn. The day I decided to fill my sons liquid hydrocodone RX a week before his surgery and save it for myself. The day I had my sister and law get her wisdom teeth pulled out so I can exchange my xanax for her pain meds. Left turns. 

I have made my final right turn. Two nights ago when my son read me an entire book? Right turn. Battling a craving after a trigger and going to Jeronimo for support? Right turn. Dedicating every ounce of my time, loyalty and energy to my loved ones. Right turn. 

The biggest misconception that addicts believe is that they are in control of their addictions. When in reality they are in control of you. No person wants to neglect their children willingly, no person wants to be so desperate for drug money that they sell their body. It's the addiction fueling that behavior. 


As I wipe away a steady flow of tears from my cheek I write this, I know now that life should never have been that hard and didn't need to be. All I had to do was speak up. I have a voice. One I myself couldn't hear, screaming for help. My subconscious was scratching at the walls within the core of me, begging, pleading to be let free. 

I'm thankful for speaking up to myself, to Jeronimo and to all of you. I'm thankful to be alive. I am thankful to be sober. 

I conquered the single largest obstacle of my life only to be rewarded with riches. I am by no means wealthy, you can not find my riches in stores. My life is rich with love, with pride, with esteem and value. I realize now that those I hold near to me are irreplaceable and to have ever jeopardized the luxury of having them kills me.

about two weeks ago, as usual i was basically spending all my money on roxies, food and transportation. literally making 600 - 800/week and nothing saved up. i had one day where i couldn't cop and i was feeling reaaaaally bad. all achy, depressed, moody, etc. i knew it was time for a real break, but that it wouldn't be found in the environment where i've been getting high for the past three years.

i had plans to go to montreal to visit a friend, and i figured it would be the perfect time to 'force myself' to get clean. so it's the morning of, i had just bought 6x30s the night before to go on a last hoorah (my usage was about 30 - 60mg/day) and i had ~50mg left. so i blow that, take a bump of k, smoke a joint and start my journey north. boy was i feeling good, but starting to get anxious of how i'd feel when i got to montreal. thinking i would be sick and feeling like shit. now in the past when i went to france, i got incredibly fucked up on the plane, and woke up feeling like i hadn't been using opiates daily for the past year and a half.

so i'm on the train, dozing in and out, and the high wears off. and i'm fine. i get to canada, and it's not even like i'm achy or fiending. i'm able to get some hydromorphone while i'm there, and though i got high once out of the two days i used, i wasn't even that 'high.' so i go the rest of the vacation with out using opis, just smoking pot and drinking a little. finally its the day that i leave, i hop on the train and the first thing i did when i came home was get 4*15mgs from my guy who picked me up at penn station. so naturally i go home, get some weed and get fucked up. same thing the day after. then, i had no more weed or anything and i'm happy to say that today is eight days clean for me off opis, with no cravings or anything.

i think it helps that i got fired from my job upon return and have only had 100$ to spend the past week, and obviously when i need to go look for a job, i need money to get there and back home so i can't go spending my last amounts on drugs.

i'm worried that when i start getting a check again i'll fall back. so ultimately my plan is to save up and gtfo of this place where i have so many memories engrained in my head of me getting high everywhere i look, from my bedroom to the stairwell to the bus and random places in nyc.

i don't know where i'm going with this, but thanks for reading. i hope i'll be able to continue this little clean streak once i find a job. i don't even have bags under my eyes anymore (except for after when i smoke pot, but usually i have bags 24/7), and even my ex remarked to me that i looked better.

I just wanted to stop in and say that today is 2 weeks off of Suboxone.  Holy shit... I didn't think it was possible.  It is. 

Here's what I've been doing every day to stay the course:

1. Wake up every morning and the first thought before I even open my eyes is the conscious decision to stay clean/sober for the entire day, no matter what, good or bad. Just for today.  

2. Ask my higher power to help me stay sober and to help me stay willing to take the next step in front of me as it appears.

3. Call my sponsor everyday.  This builds positive habits in case shit were to hit the fan, my body is trained in what to do, to call someone and let them know what's going on.

4.  Actively work a program of recovery. The 12 steps. For me, I go to AA &amp; CA (CA is cocaine anonymous and it's basically AA where you can talk about drugs openly).

5.  Continue reaching my hand out and meeting new people in the rooms of recovery to build a solid support network of sober/clean people.

6. Come to /r/OpiatesRecovery to listen to you guys/gals about what you are going through and add any advice I can to the discussion.  (This place has been a true god send over the past few weeks for my recovery and keeping things in perspective.)

I've been waiting to hear about this for two weeks. This morning I was actually sort of hoping that I wouldn't get it so I would have an excuse to go pick up today. But that's not really an excuse is it? If I go buy a bunch of heroin because I get turned down for a job that I was barely qualified for anyway then how can I honestly say that I think I'm the best candidate for the next one?

I don't want to be the person who runs to shoot up at the first sign of trouble. I made it past that first big urge to go but now I'm sitting here just... stunned. Today is day 2 being totally opiate free (after a kratom taper 5 days before). My limbs feel like lead but my leg is still bouncing like a typewriter. 

Logically I know the next steps. I apply for jobs. I need a shitty local job so that I can support myself. I need to apply for more ""career"" jobs that might take a long time to work through applications and find one that I can actually get. I need to keep exercising, working on my SMART stuff, journaling. I need to take my naltrexone. 

But all I want to do right now is sit on the couch and stare at the wall. I invested so much of myself in this job. This is what triggered my first serious attempt at getting clean since March. This was my dream job. I know that picking up would be stupid. I know that's not who I want to be. I just sent them a respectful email asking for feedback about how I could improve.

I've been waiting to hear about this for two weeks. This morning I was actually sort of hoping that I wouldn't get it so I would have an excuse to go pick up today.

If I go buy a bunch of heroin because I get turned down for a job that I was barely qualified for anyway then how can I honestly say that I think I'm the best candidate for the next one?

I don't want to be the person who runs to shoot up at the first sign of trouble. I made it past that first big urge to go but now I'm sitting here just... stunned. Today is day 2 being totally opiate free (after a kratom taper 5 days before). My limbs feel like lead but my leg is still bouncing like a typewriter. 

Logically I know the next steps. I apply for jobs. I need a shitty local job so that I can support myself. I need to apply for more ""career"" jobs that might take a long time to work through applications and find one that I can actually get. I need to keep exercising, working on my SMART stuff, journaling. I need to take my naltrexone. 

But all I want to do right now is sit on the couch and stare at the wall. I invested so much of myself in this job. This is what triggered my first serious attempt at getting clean since March. This was my dream job. I know that picking up would be stupid. I know that's not who I want to be. I just sent them a respectful email asking for feedback about how I could improve.

Been hanging out with this girl who has it pretty bad. Multiple ""mental illnesses"" that may or may not be accurately diagnosed. Bipolar, Schizophrenia, ADHD, Disassociative Identity Disorder (? wtf). I had little idea what I was getting myself into. Long story short, this girl is on a crap ton of psyche meds. We're talking when I first met her I was bangin' dilaudid and she was poppin' 6mg xanax daily on top of 120 latuda, 300mg lamictal, 100mg thorazine twice daily, 10mg ambien bedtime, 20mg adderall four times daily, remeron 30mg bedtime. I know all of this because she made me dose her. She didn't trust herself, so she made me dispense it for her in order to hold her accountable because these are all prescribed to her but she doesn't have to free-will to take it as prescribed! Anyway, one day I wasn't able to hang with her, so she of course ""relapsed"" and took a bunch of her meds. Now she's short and come the end of her script (right now) with 2 weeks before her next MD appointment and the girls borderline about to have a seizure on me. So away we go to inpatient. Drop her off and basically wave good-bye at our local psyche facility (which she requested by name and knew exactly what not to bring, ETC.) I couldn't help but laugh when she knew not to grab the shampoo that doesn't have alcohol in it and the pajamas that don't have strings on them.
Reason I share this is because this girl has played a Major part in my recovery. She has helped turn me into a clean, honest, and downright gentlemen over the course of the last 2 months. I was a beast before I met her and she helped mold me into an adult in a very short amount of time. Of course, I was more than willing to do it all, but I really can't say I'd be the same if I hadn't of stumbled on her doorstep (literally). Now that I'm clean, she isn't, the tables have turned and she is the dangerous one to me now. I find it ironic because I attend NA and there's a verse in there somewhere that says something like, ""the therapuetic value of one addict helping another is without parallel."" ""Dangerous grounds my friend"" is what my sponsor says to me every time I bring her into the conversation. He wants me to get away from her (for obvious reasons). I'm not willing to do that. I want to get her a little better, but at the same time, I don't really know if it's even a good idea for her to get off her xanax in the first place! She is the most unstable person I have ever met. With all those psyche diagnoses, without her medication she is a walking time-bomb. With all her medication she has highs and lows like I've never seen before, and I've been around a lot of fucked up people. I don't know where to go now, and I've grown emotionally attached to the woman. I'm beginning to feel as though she is just going to be permanently like that and there's no way in hell she will every be a ""normal"" human being again (whatever that is).
Anyways, enough about her. I've just been battling with my own demons lately since she got ""locked up"". This is good for me (us). We have been spending nearly every waking second together. It feels good to have some peace and quiet and reflect on my own problems instead of trying to play it cool in front of somebody else that cares so deeply about you. That being said, I'm so glad and proud of myself for how far I have come. I have a little bit of loose stools every now and then and pass a lot of gas.

Maybe just for some support to know someone else is going through something similar.


So as of right now I have a year and seven months clean. I'm on a methadone maintenance program and have been slowly reducing my dose. I know some people don't consider being of methadone being clean, but whatever. When I started the program a year and seven months ago, I wanted to keep my dose low so it'd be easier to get off. I was on 50mg daily for almost a year. I've been going down about one milligram a week for a while. Tomorrow I go down to 19mg. I had almost three years clean before I relapsed for about a year.


Anyway. This time I'm trying to do things right and I haven't used any drugs. I have the occasional beer or two on holidays or special occasions. I had one beer last weekend when me and my best friend went out to eat, which was the first time since February. I felt very slightly buzzed after one beer. We ended up having a really great time. I rarely go out anymore and we usually​ just hang out at his house. I don't know if it was me associating the beer with the good time had or what but it's making me want to drink. I'm sure I could've had a good time without the drink, but I almost felt loosened up.


Then I'm watching the show Shameless and there's a guy character who's an addict and relapses. And it made me remember the feeling of shooting up and kinda crave it. Like I know it'll only bring pain and would ruin my life. But why do I have cravings after this long clean. Last time I relapsed, I was drinking a lot after a break up from my first ""real"" love, started hanging out with the wrong girl and ended up using while drunk and spiraled from there.
 

I don't want to start regularly drinking again either, but part of me is almost associating the good time I had this weekend with the one beer I had with lunch. I know it's not going to fix any depressed feelings I have or make anything better. I can justify one drink with a meal a few times a year. But wanting to drink, just to get buzzed is a feeling I don't want to be having. 


I keep telling myself to stop feeling these cravings because I know it'd only lead to bad things. For all the goods times I had drinking or using heroin, there are double the bad things. I'm trying to focus on the bad memories, but this feeling in my stomach that wants to use won't go away. I know I'm not going to. I've deleted any and all contacts to buy dope and I'm not gonna let myself go buy booze and drink alone. But these intrusive thoughts are bothering me. I think it's part of bad coping mechanism I developed of running for a substance when getting sad or trying to block feelings. I struggle with depressive episodes sometimes. Usually I can handle them just fine and cravings like these are rare. But this week it's been stronger.

My other option is just stopping the dope Friday night and using the comfort meds until until I can start a quick 2-3 day suboxone taper.

If I were to go this route I'd probably wait until Sunday night/Monday morning and take 4mg sub, then 2 the next day then 1 the next day. I'd still be taking the comfort meds while I do the sub taper....last time I tried to take suboxone I waited 36 hours but still went into terrible precipitated wd . 

Any advise would be appreciated.

I ask myself that same question, around the same time, every single time that I put myself through this nightmare. I guess demanding that your body feel better after an 8 month, 180mg daily oxycodone enslavement is a tall order. I will give it a little grace and hopefully more time.

Unfortunately, like clockwork, I wake up at 2:30am.. This is my normal early Wednesday/ early Friday routine. Solid connect is awake and off of work and I got a fresh direct deposit sometime after midnight. It is incredibly hard not to call this guy up and get 4 or 5. I fantasize about how I want to take them, rationalize blowing $150 to feel better again, hell I don't even really mind the drive.. 

And the cycle continues.. it would be almost humorous if it wasn't so incredibly destructive. Im telling you, it's a real Dr. Jeckyl - Mr. Hyde thing for me. Every ounce of bliss I enjoy while using no matter how good must be paid back. Every single one. It will take months for me to feel even close to normal again.  Yet, here I lay... Sick as hell, legs will not relax (and probably won't for days), I'm alert and awake but I know that I need to sleep, every muscle hurts, I just threw up, i keep yawning and tearing up, depressed, anxious, fatalistic... But, I'm actually doing this shit! I went and saw some friends tonight and actually had a wonderful time, on top of that a college buddy gave me a call I hadn't seen in years. I was able to actually be engaged in the conversations.. I was funny again if it was even for a moment. It was actually nice.

I just want to give you guys some mad love for contributing to this sub and giving me hope. This has been an incredible resource for me. I just want my life back.. I want to wake up and not need to take anything to feel well. I want to be me again. I want to be free.

In fact, it just hit me that this could be the last time I ever have to go through opiate withdrawal in my life. I'm already this far why turn back now?

Well, I'm going to watch some House and hopefully drift off.. all I have to help with withdrawals is a little herb. I don't normally smoke but I have found it helps me sleep and eat a little bit easier in w/d.. I guess it's better than getting loaded on xanax and ambien for 4-5 days like I normally do then just end up using again anyways. Still holding out for the emotional crash however.. I am not Superman. My high water mark is 108 hours..

I've been using heroin for ~3 years now. DOC: ECP, ROA: Insufflation. Its hard to really remember when it was exactly that I started; everything in my life since then has been a volatile vortex of despair, depression, and addiction.

I think I'll take the time eventually to write up some abstract about myself but I'm not very experienced at making reddit posts -- just reading them haha.

Anyway it feels really weird to break the circuit of self-contained success and failure, aside from my brother, by posting on /r/opiatesrecovery. Good weird, though. There are a lot of you on here who have been hurting and make posts to get advice. I just want to start by saying how brave I think each and every one of you are for putting yourself out there. I can not thank you all enough because it has been so hard for me to take my recovery seriously and during the past 33 days I've been clean and I've felt more support through strangers talking to other strangers about their common enemy than I have ever felt in real life, around real people.

Anyway, sorry for ramblin', but I would like to say that I'd like the camaraderie and accountability if you guys would have me. Also, I'm going to my first meeting ever tonight and I'm so nervous I've literally been shaking during writing this whole post. It's like I feel like as soon as I walk in and am acknowledged that I will completely break down or jet out the door. I dont know. Anyway, thanks guys!

I had a kratom addiction for a while. I won't go into detail about it, since I want this post to be about coping mechanisms for withdrawing, but my withdrawls were always intense. Depression, anxiety, that horrible constant grubby feeling all over your skin, restless legs that last for days, etc.

Things that have helped me:

1. Constant showers. Honestly I think the worst part of withdrawal is the mental part, followed very closely by the grubby painful skin feeling and restless legs pain. Showering helps both of those for me.

2. Lobelia herb. There are a bunch of supplements touted to help opiate withdrawl like Cat's Claw, Black Seed Oil, Skullcap, etc. But the only ones that have worked for me have been Loperamide (Immodium) and Lobelia. I hate Loperamide because it gives me horrible bloating (no offense ImagineImmodium lol) and also because it feels like an opiate in very high doses (probably why I felt so bloated also.)

Plus i've been lurking this sub ALLL day and you guys know your stuff on kicking this crap. Today was my first day of withdrawl from opana but I failed and picked up :/ not even cause I was craving it or cause I was having terrible symptoms (besides a little depression which always comes first for me and usually after 12 hours of the last dose.) because I took 40mg of Lope this morning, but because I was bored. Picking up today raised a question that I think needs to be answered and the answer is key to me finally kicking this stuff and staying away which I want more than everything i've ever wanted. But my question is this:

Why do I fail to see the natural beauty in life without drugs? 

How come i'm incapable of seeing positive things in life unless i'm high? Even just relaxing and watching my favorite show or listening to music is hard to enjoy unless i'm on something. Without drugs I just feel..bored, incapable of living life, helpless. I hate this. I want to be able to see the good things without being high. I have depression even without drugs so maybe getting into therapy is something I need to do but problem is, I don't have insurance. I don't even know where to start without that. 

You guys have helped me tremendously today without even knowing it. Reading all your stories of how well you're doing is really inspiring. And it made me wanna stay clean for good instead of just getting clean to the point where I can get high again which is what I usually do which means I go through withdrawals roughly once a month. But i'm tired of it. I hope some of you have asked yourself the question above and I hope you found the answer and were able to curve that stigma. And I hope you will share with me how you stopped this. Any feedback would be awesome and I love the positivity on this sub. Tomorrow's a new day but its another battle with myself which seems to never end.

I'm working on getting off suboxone. I'm not on a huge dose (2mg) but am having trouble making the final push. I've been entertaining the thought of an inpatient facility but have heard so many horror stories about them and I'm terrified.

They gave me perc 10s and once they ran out the heroin started again. So here I am, at home, 24 yr old male, I dropped out of Grad school because it was giving me way too much stress and giving me an excuse to leave the house to get high. So i decided to eradicate that avenue. 

Now I have a lot of free time. Job recruiters have been calling me now that my schedule is open and my family is giving me a hard time.

I understand why they are scared to death. I get they feel betrayed and all that. My father won't even talk to me. After so many relapses and lies they are fed up. Once i presented this job interview that I have today for a pretty decent job, everyone lost it. They just don't trust me. 

The trust issue factor makes me cry everyday. The fact that my family doesn't have faith in me and showing less love for me makes me very very sad. 

I know it's too early. I'm still on subs to combat the withdrawal because it's only been a few days. But I feel like I need to push myself and not fester. I've been working out and just came back from the interview and it went super fantastic. Just gotta wait for round 2 of interviewing. 

I understand my family's worry and trust issues. I get their anger. I know. I've betrayed, lied, deceived, and hurt them so much so often that it makes me want to die. And honestly, that's what led to me not trying to stop doing heroin because the overwhelming shame and sadness that i've created makes me want to just get high and forget everything.

But i can't run anymore. I'm taking .5mg xanax at night to ease anxiety and sleep. I am slowly weening down my suboxone doses. I'm already at like 1.5mg so i'm ok. I smoke weed during the day and at night again to help eat and sleep. I just want this to all be over. I want my family's trust again. I want it to be like how it was before the drugs. 

I am basically grounded and can't leave my house. Which i'm perfectly OK with. My bro hooks me up with the subs, weed and xanax. He even buys me video games and hangs out with me more often. But he is still very very mad at me. 

Everyone says what I did was evil. But i'm not evil... they think I made a willing choice to hurt them. AND THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. They think i wanted to hurt them purposely. They don't get that the overwhelming craving and desire to feel normal is insane! 

Not picking up the phone and making everyone worry and think i'm dead, blowing everyone off to just get high is bad i know. Especially after they already know my heroin problem. They don't understand though. The shame and guilt is overwhelming. Not to mention the anxiety that i've had my entire life. 

I'm going to the psychiatrist Oct. 28 to get a diagnosis and see what he can do to help my anxiety, which is the reason I started doing drugs in the first place, to relieve my anxiety.

My names Osusanna, and I am an addict. So, I've been on suboxone for close to a year now and for now I am happy with my dosage and doing really well. I even recently quit smoking pot and realized I am MUCH happier without it. I have also just started exercising and I am absolutely amazed at the fact I can do so without feeling like absolute shit afterwards. It also gives me an AWESOME body and mind high that it totally new to me. Before I started subs, I struggled with addiction to pain pills, any and all I could get my hands on, from the age of about 18 until 31. So there's just a little background on myself. 

A few weeks ago, my father told me a very interesting tidbit of info. When I was a baby, about 6 months old or so, he and my mom took me to see a neurologist because I was constantly wiggling my hand back and forth. All day long, twisting my hand from side to side.  After some questions for my parents it came out that my mom was taking A LOT of codeine while pregnant with me (I guess doctors were a lot more lax and/or uneducated about those things back in those days.) So the doctor said it was probably due to being born in withdrawals and probably still being affected one way or another from the codeine. Of course this really upset my mother who walked out in a huff, and the doctor said to my dad he ""guaranteed"" that in 20 or 30 years they would see that I would end up with some problems due to the codeine. 

And obviously later on I ended up with a pretty serious addiction. It just makes me wonder, would my brain have developed in some way that would really give me a taste for opiates, and have a super addictive personality? I struggled with really bad depression even from a young age. And then the first time I tried any opiates (yup, Tylenol with codeine) I felt, finally, like a whole person, as if a huge part of me that was missing was finally in place again (as long as I was high.) 

Anyway. I just found it really interesting. I know a LOT of people who, if prescribed pain killers, HATE how they feel and would rather suffer in pain than take pain pills, whereas I LOVED the feeling and craved it instantly. I've googled for info but haven't found anything concrete on the long term affects of opiate addiction in newborns.

Yesterday, Day 6 was a nightmare. My sleep issues were bad, as I know they are for many, but night 5 I got zero sleep. Litteraly watched the sun come up and finally just broke down and cried for an hour in my wife's arms. And then had to go to shower, shave, and go to work. I could barely form cohesive sentences and managed to ditch out at 2. I got a 30 minute nap, and managed some soup at 6:00, was asleep by 8 and got 7 1/2 hours. So now I'm up, but I'm OK.

I know I'm not done. I'm sure there will still be some GI issues, some more sleep problems, and all the mind games to come. But this feels good. A very key milestone. No fucking way I'm going back through that again. It's **never again** time.

Oh boy. The project turn around time is 4 weeks to complete a photoshoot, video shoot, print material and a commercial. (That's an insane timeline, on average completing a video project takes at least a month or two).

In any case, I used to be excited about these kinds of challenges, I remember that about myself. And I was definitely feeling excited again tonight. However, my brain is all fucked up...

Those feelings of excitement as I was talking timeline with the clients started to get muddled in with excitement/nervousness about using. 

""Holy hell that's. Quick turn around! This is gunnu be a lot of work! A lot of work... Huh... You're gunnu have to stay up late after work... Really no time for anything else... Will you even be able to make the deadlines? Hm. You know, if you just picked up enough for the weekends, it'll give you enough energy/relaxation to pull through those long hours... Why not? I mean, it's just a little boost... Yeah I don't think I can make these deadlines sober... Shit, why does my back hurt, I feel tired... Damn it was that the chills? The chills are back? Fuck, maybe I should pick up...""

Spiral spiral spiral. You get to the point where you're 100% convinced it's all a good plan. You talk yourself back into physical withdrawls. Damn the brains a scheming bastard. 

It's like the cravings and pain hibernate, just waiting till they get a scent of an opportunity, then use all their saved up energy to attack with all ferocity and coerce you into doing it. 

It's saddens me that my emotions are still not fixed. That when I do feel excitement or anxiousness for something, that opiates somehow accompany the thought process, though they have nothing to do with it.

But I'm trying. Hell, I didn't pick up the whole drive home, I tried everything in my power to talk myself down for that pick up fever. I'm sober today, tonight. And that's another battle won.

I know these 4 weeks are going to be hard. Fun and scary all at once. But gods I hope they don't turn into an excuse.

(That's an insane timeline, on average completing a video project takes at least a month or two).

In any case, I used to be excited about these kinds of challenges, I remember that about myself. And I was definitely feeling excited again tonight. However, my brain is all fucked up...

Those feelings of excitement as I was talking timeline with the clients started to get muddled in with excitement/nervousness about using. 

""Holy hell that's. Quick turn around! This is gunnu be a lot of work! A lot of work... Huh... You're gunnu have to stay up late after work... Really no time for anything else... Will you even be able to make the deadlines? Hm. You know, if you just picked up enough for the weekends, it'll give you enough energy/relaxation to pull through those long hours... Why not? I mean, it's just a little boost... Yeah I don't think I can make these deadlines sober... Shit, why does my back hurt, I feel tired... Damn it was that the chills? The chills are back? Fuck, maybe I should pick up...""

Spiral spiral spiral. You get to the point where you're 100% convinced it's all a good plan. You talk yourself back into physical withdrawls. Damn the brains a scheming bastard. 

It's like the cravings and pain hibernate, just waiting till they get a scent of an opportunity, then use all their saved up energy to attack with all ferocity and coerce you into doing it. 

It's saddens me that my emotions are still not fixed. That when I do feel excitement or anxiousness for something, that opiates somehow accompany the thought process, though they have nothing to do with it.

But I'm trying. Hell, I didn't pick up the whole drive home, I tried everything in my power to talk myself down for that pick up fever. I'm sober today, tonight. And that's another battle won.

I know these 4 weeks are going to be hard. Fun and scary all at once. But gods I hope they don't turn into an excuse.

I'm young, in otherwise good health, but a couple of years ago I had an injury that made working slightly difficult. It was just a persistent gnawing pain that I wanted gone. It took a long time to get seen by a physiotherapist and by then I was on co-codamol.

I've never done recreational drugs before. I once tried smoking a bit of a cigarette and a cigar but they were way too much! Heh. And I rarely drink alcohol too. I didn't drink at all until I was in my mid 20's.

I was prescribed co-codamol (30, 500). Take 2 when the pain appears, no more than 8 tablets a day. And I never did take more than I had to. But I found that I started preempting the pain, like when I was going to watch a film or go out I'd take some. Half for the pain, half for how chilled out it made me.

5 months of that and I accidentally tell the doc I still have the pain (which I did). He prescribed Tramadol as well but to never mix them with the co-codamol. I read online that you can (to a degree) so I did. I was only doing that for maybe 2 weeks when I realised I didn't need the cocodamol any more. But then I started getting funny.

In the mornings I'd be grumpy and irritable. I had arguments with my girlfriend to the point where we were walking around a city and she was crying. It was ridiculous and not me.

Day 1: At first I thought it was depression. I went to the docs on an emergency appointment and told her I was really down. I was prescribed an antidepressant.

2: I felt okay because I was taking the tramadol but I took the antidepressant.

3: Took 2 doses of tramadol over the course of the day whilst at a relatives birthday party (elderly-ish so just a normal family party type thing)

4: Hellish morning. I couldn't operate at all. My gf suggested we go for a drive and it did help pass the time. She was a star. She took me for a picnic and I had a big cry. Walking back to the car and I felt tired but happy. I took a tramadol in the evening.

5 (FIRST DAY OF NO TRAMADOL): Bad morning again but I realised it's going to be the painkillers causing this! I read up on it and sure enough I was right. I ticked all the symptoms. I managed to get some work done today and felt happy knowing what was causing my depression.

6 (FIRST DAY OF NO CO-CODAMOL): Bad morning! I went out for the day just walking around the city. I did feel so much better though, I was 10/10 back to normal for a good 8 hours. It felt amazing.

7: This is today. I woke up feeling anxious and depressed. I couldn't get my body temperature right. The smallest tasks seem huge.

I know I wasn't on a huge dose. Sporadic taking of regular Co-codamol doses for 5 months, then sporadic dual use of co-codamol and tramadol for 2 weeks, then just tramadol for another 2 weeks. But it's compounding all my natural depression and anxiety. It's not good at all.

Thankfully I don't feel at all like taking any more. I know that doing so will only protract this out.

Recently had 6+ months then had a relapse that lasted about a month. The 6 month period was really the only time I felt the joy and greatfulness that comes with ""recovery"". was going to meetings and totally abstinent. Last week I did a self administered short term Sub detox. Worked well enough to by pass the physical withdrawals but the mental was still there. Today I relapsed. I hate this and want back into recovery. I know what I need to do, meetings, exercise and get back into living life day at a time.

We can all do this, and life can better. I need to remind myself that I am not doomed to a life of misery and things can and do get better.

While I was at the party, I was thinking out loud about how I had missed out on celebrating the other four birthdays of his life when she reminded me that I had actually been at his birthday party last year. I was wondering how it was that I managed to completely block this memory out of my mind, but on this day a year ago, I was a stranger.

I was asked recently if I have ever given any thought to the idea that I was never really ""there"" during my addiction. I mean, sure we are there physically, and some might could even argue consciously we are there, but we aren't really. Heroin makes us numb and fucked up. When this thought was first brought up to me, I don't think I fully grasped it, but today, I had that moment. That moment of emotional clarity of realizing TODAY I was there. Last year, I wasn't. 

Last year, I was running away from yet another huge fight between me and my ex boyfriend. This one was a doozy. He had wanted to pick up a gram of H and we had $150 left to our name. I agreed to let him do it anyway, because I could never say no to him, and while I knew I would regret being broke later, I could feel numb and forget about it for at least a few hours before we started worrying about money again. Only, my ex somehow managed to lose the money in between picking it up from the ATM and making it home. We were both in a panic, crying, screaming at each other, blaming each other for our addiction. He went for a walk to cool off, and I texted my sister to vent where I explained what happened (leaving out the part of us going to use the money to score) and I said awful things about him. I insulted his limp dick; his failure to keep a job. I compared him to the stray cat that had shown up at our apartment complex recently, saying that everyone feels sorry for him and wants to feed him and give him shelter from the heat, but no one really wanted to keep him for life. I felt better getting that off my chest. 

By morning, I had figured out a way for us to score. I talked a friend from my home town into driving up to where we lived, so we could help him score. Heroin was pretty nonexistant in my hometown last summer,  and when it did come around it was fucking expensive. We could charge him double for getting him a half G and we would still be getting him a cheap deal. So he came up the next morning to cop a G, and we were going to cop one of our own on his dime. My boyfriend almost always did the middling himself, but this time he had  me do it. He was still a little sour from our argument the night before. As we walked out the door to pick up, I remembered that I didn't have our dude's number stored in my phone, so my boyfriend threw me his and said, ""just use mine"". I left my phone behind with him. Long story short, he decided to snoop through my phone and read everything I had said about him the night before. We got into our worst fight ever, and when it started to turn into a physical fight, my friend made him leave my apartment and made me pack a bag of my clothes to leave with him. I was actually crying that he made him leave. Here I had a friend that was trying to protect me from getting my face knocked in, and I was upset that he made my boyfriend leave and was making me get the hell out of town. When people tried to step in between us, it only made us closer, so of course before I could make it out of town, I was already calling him crying, telling him I loved him, that he could come back to the apartment once I was gone, that I left him half of the dope we scored. That no one could keep us from being together. 

The biggest horror we commit when using, is robbing people of ourselves. Last year, I was at my little cousin's birthday party, but I don't remember it because I was fucked up from the last of the dope left over from middling for my friend the day before. I had already forgotten about the ugly words my boyfriend and I had said to each other, I was ok with the fact that he had put his hands on me, and I was comfortable with going back to this life...as long as I could keep getting high too. And that was what I was mostly worried about, since I had did the last of the dope I brought with me and now I had to think of another scheme to get more. Crossing more lines. No wonder I don't remember being at the birthday party last year; I wasn't. 

When I wasn't able to come up with a scheme to get us more money and more dope, I thought maybe I should get clean. I remember posting in r/opiates for the first time, breaking down and resolving that it was the only and best option for me at that point, and that I believed I could do it. I lasted maybe 3 days. Today, exactly a year later, I am 5 days away from being 5 months clean. I am so fucking proud of myself I could cry. And maybe I will. Today, I am here.

Before you condemn me- I will get around to cross posting on r/opiates recovery. I am currently almost finished with my first full day of sobriety. Man does it fucking suck. But I want to compile a list of things that have made it easier an even bearable at times for me. I'm not a doctor but lord knows I could be a great pharmacist.

Things that have helped me:

Benzos- your gonna be anxious when you start your detox. If your like me, then there's not a lot worse than sitting around feeling anxious. Fix it. I was fortunate to get a doc to prescribe me klonopin, which I favor because it lasts a long time. Ativan also works well. I know NA people will disagree with using other drugs to get off another but then again a lot of people don't agree with NA. This is was is working currently for me

Weed- I know another drug, but come on at least your getting off heroin (physically)with its help. It will distract your mind from the mountains of body aches you'll be feeling

Ibiprofin- for aches. Didn't help me out that much.

Cigarettes- if u smoke, one addiction at a time. Although it would ideally be good to stop both addictions, if your like me say fuck it one at a time. Plus the nicotine gives u temporary relief from body aches and anxiety. Plus u usually poo afterwards.

Hot shower- something about it made me feel the best I have all day. The warm water is reminiscent of the warm rush that comes over you on opiates without the cost. After me shower igot on my bed FEELING LIKEa I CAN ACTUALLY SLEEP.

NyQuil, ambien- sleepy stuff

And if shit is getting way to real, take a little bit of suboxone if you have it, but only if the wds become unbearable like they did when i tried to sleep last night.

I know you guys are having fun being junkies, I was there and might be again if I fuck up. But remember THE LONGER YOU WAIT TO QUIT THE WORSE THE WITHDRAWLS WILL BE. Also Iv use can damage your heart valves- shit. Have fun, but don't let yourself become a slave.

Over time a noticeable distance was forming. Buck was staying the same and I was getting better. Where I took direction and moved as quickly as possible through the work Buck stalled and never fully committed. After a few months he disappeared. 

about 6 months later he came back. It was awesome! I was so happy to see him. He had just got out of rehab and seemed willing. At first.

Throughout this past winter he would randomly call me asking for help. A ride to a meeting or detox or just a conversation. The last one I had with him I actually told him he was going to die if he didn't get help. I don't know how I feel about having said that now. He asked for a ride to detox and we were on our way to get him when he called and said never mind his mom was taking him. I knew it was a lie.

They were so, so, right. 7 months sober.","WARNING: Happy post :) 

Thanks to everyone on here who has offered advice to me in the past, it's really helped me get through troubling times! 

For the longest time I stayed in my house, ate a lot of fast food and slept all day long. I was very depressed and even though I had no intention to use, I hated being clean. I wanted to kill myself for the longest time, and I probably would have done it if I had the energy. 

Two months ago I took some classes on how to apply to jobs (I'd been an addict so long I forgot how to do it). They helped me write a resume and taught me how to interview and get around the legal issues. It only took 3 weeks and I had nearly 7 interviews lined up. I was offered 3 positions, and eventually I settled on the best one.

 I now work in medium duty truck repair, which has always been my field of choice. It's a very interesting field because I've never worked on trucks like this. I was an Army mechanic (91B) for nearly 4 years before I was discharged, but I always had supervision. Now I'm working on trucks all by myself, learning new and incredible things every day. I can't say what kind of trucks I work on because then someone could find out where my job is, but they're very expensive trucks. The pay is very good, so good that I never thought I'd get this job (it's an apprenticeship by the way), but I did. 

My family offered to help me take out a loan for a car if I got a job, and when they realized that I was going to be doing great things they offered to buy it immediately. I was using the extra family car before, but two days ago I officially got a new car. 

So guys, here I am. I'm alive and well. Two years ago I was pimping out girls, dealing and hurting, constantly sick. Today I'm working a 40 hour a week job with my own car, and soon to be apartment. Holy shit I never thought I'd be here. I'm so happy, and sometimes I don't think I deserve it, but it's still the most amazing thing ever. 

This is an incredible feeling, and I never want it to go away. 

I love being sober, I love living life.

TL;DR: Sober 7 months, overcame depression and got an apprenticeship working medium duty truck repair (semi-trucks). Family helped me finance a car and now I'm driving my OWN vehicle for the first time in nearly 6 years. Life is turning around and I feel like I'm going to explode with happiness.

I posted something like this in the Wednesday check in thread, but I wanted to share for visibility for anyone struggling. I am 40 days clean today and feeling great, and although I have a long road ahead of me, I wanted to share an experience I had yesterday that really put things into perspective:

""Today has been an amazing day. I feel spectacular, and work was so positive. I'm a network engineer, and we've been struggling trying to install wireless APs in a chapel. Why they want wireless in here is beyond me, but who am I to judge. I've had an old Italian lady come up to me a few times while I was on my phone answering emails in the chapel to yell at me, saying God doesn't communicate through cell phone, only prayer. Gave me a good laugh. It's been 3 weeks of disappointment because it was built in 1900 and there's no pathways for cables to come up from the basement. Every solution I provide gets shot down because we're not allowed to do any demo or drilling to scope out pathways. FINALLY today, after a lengthy redesign, I finally came up with a viable solution that got approved. If I was still using, I would've just been like meh, finally. But today I felt that joy and satisfaction that comes from weeks of hard work. I've suppressed my emotions for so long, and it felt amazing to finally feel these emotions again. Keep it up people! Sober life is SO much more fulfilling.""

For all of you still in the single digits or struggling through that first month, I hope this gives you some motivation to stay clean. The joy I got when I felt raw emotion and happiness for the first time in probably 3 years, almost brought me to tears. As active addicts, it's easy to forget how to feel. Everything is numbed, and even successes just feel like meh. To be 100% sober, and get that feeling that comes with weeks of hard work that FINALLY pay off, the feeling was a better rush than H ever gave me. PLEASE people, keep it up.

God, I felt like a piece of shit.


i beat myself up all the time for being weak enough to fall victim to opiates &amp; I was too ashamed to talk to anyone about it.  It was a terrible time.  


I have been through cancer treatment,: surgery, chemo, and radiation.  I can tell you that the dope sickness, both physical and mental, was much worse than that experience.  When getting off drugs, I always felt that I was weak willed &amp; could *do something* about feeling better.  With cancer, there is no control.  I only choice I had was to fight it.  I couldn't ""will"" it away, like I thought I could with my addiction.


The first year was really hard.  I had to speak to a lot of people who got off drugs and were staying off drugs.  I asked them how they did it.  I agreed with some of it, and didn't agree with other parts of it.  I had to find my own way.

Ultimately, though, I had to realize that I was never going to stay clean if i continued to treat myself the way I had.  I would never be a friend to someone who treated me the way I treated myself.  I would ostracize myself for fucking up.  I would  tell myself I was better off dead.  I would tell myself I could never do it.  I hated myself. 

What I needed was to encourage myself.  I needed to love myself.  I needed to take care of myself.  I needed to allow myself to make mistakes.

God, I felt like a piece of shit.


i beat myself up all the time for being weak enough to fall victim to opiates &amp; I was too ashamed to talk to anyone about it.  It was a terrible time.  


I have been through cancer treatment,: surgery, chemo, and radiation.  I can tell you that the dope sickness, both physical and mental, was much worse than that experience.  When getting off drugs, I always felt that I was weak willed &amp; could *do something* about feeling better.  With cancer, there is no control.  I only choice I had was to fight it.  I couldn't ""will"" it away, like I thought I could with my addiction.


The first year was really hard.  I had to speak to a lot of people who got off drugs and were staying off drugs.  I asked them how they did it.  I agreed with some of it, and didn't agree with other parts of it.  I had to find my own way.

Ultimately, though, I had to realize that I was never going to stay clean if i continued to treat myself the way I had.  I would never be a friend to someone who treated me the way I treated myself.  I would ostracize myself for fucking up.  I would  tell myself I was better off dead.  I would tell myself I could never do it.  I hated myself. 

What I needed was to encourage myself.  I needed to love myself.  I needed to take care of myself.  I needed to allow myself to make mistakes.  I needed to realize that i had fucked up my brain and it forgot how to make chemicals to make me feel normal.  That meant I was sick.  That meant I needed to be patient with myself until my brain healed.

She is enormous.  She labored for 36 hours before discovering that we needed to go in and get her: vending machine wasn't working, it was time for the claw game.  

At hour 14 they prepared her for her epidural.  This involves a Stadol push, making the generalized pain go away enough that she was able to deal with the positioning appropriately so they could access her back.  I had to leave the room.  I could taste the rush of a push, the opiates flooding into my body and the cloud settling in.  I felt like such a baby. 

She asked me if I was alright when I came back in.  ""You shouldn't have to worry about me."" ""Yeah, but I know that was hard for you.  You OK?""  I just cried and nodded.  

After she had arrived and we had a wonderful few nights, and then our special dinner.  Right before they delivered the steaks (yeah buddy!), the nurse came in and asked her how her pain was--incision, interior, et al...  During the process she said the word Percocet 7 times.  Exactly seven.  

My wife looked at me and said, ""How many times did she say it?"" ""Seven."" She chuckled and just nodded.  When the nurse came in, my wife asked her if she could just bring the medication on schedule, and just lay it on her table, so as not to wake the baby.  I put my headphones on and watched an episode of GameGrumps while she took her meds, and then we ate our delicious steaks. 

On the way home, I could see the scripts in her lap.  Percs.  The good ones.  She could see me eyeing them, and put the papers in her folder.  We enjoyed the rest of the trip home. 

I asked her if she wanted me to go fill her script.  ""Nah. You need to get to work.  Mom is coming by.""  All smiles.  She was making a table in a notebook.  I asked what she was doing.  ""Making a table so I can keep track of my pills.  You know, when I take them and such...so I know when I need to take another.""  

It hit me.  She was protecting me.  I could have gotten so mad in that moment.  If I was defensive I could see this as a move to make sure I didn't steal from her. 

It wasn't.  It was her making sure we know, together, that those pills are for her pain maintenance, and that alone.  That way I know she isn't abusing (not a likelihood, but the peace that affords me is something I didn't even know I needed), and that I'm not abusing them.  

In a time when my wife was the absolute focus of my every thought and prayer, I was the focus of hers.  She was dedicated to helping me stay in recovery.  Why?  There's never been a moment in our relationship when I wasn't totally open about every bit of the process it takes to keep me clean on an average day, much less the hard ones. 

I married a rock star.  There's no question.  I also realized that this is how its supposed to be.  It isn't something I have to white knuckle on my own.  I **need help** and I'm getting it.

With my financial obligations, chores, finding work, etc. so it's only fitting to incorporate that into addictive behaviors. 

Procrastination is the end all for addicts. Think about it:

How many times have you said to yourself "" this is my last time."" ? Then ""only one more day. Finish the bottle off.""  Then ""ehh what's $50 more.""

An endless cycle of delaying the inevitable. I honestly don't know where the behavior or ideology stems from. I've been thinking about this a lot this evening. How many times have I told myself ""this is my last time?"".

The answer is likely hundreds. 

You think you'd want to pay your bills, the end result is your shit is paid. Cells phone service won't be disrupted. Electricity won't be shut off. Rewarding and necessary things to do on time. 

Delaying the inevitable involving addiction though, you're delaying the pain. The sickness. The agony. All while making it worse for yourself in the end. Longer the addiction the worse the withdraws. 

Delaying recovery stunted my growth as an adult, as a mother. Stunted any emotional growth. Ruined my credit and financial standing. 

Prior to being an addict, chronic procrastination was my biggest bad habit. I've been working really hard through recovery to break myself of it, and I have to say I've been relatively successful. 

No more waiting until tomorrows. Today. Today is the day. Today is your day. Today is our day.

It's not all unicorns and butterflies. It's difficult. But the end result, all of the good, all of the growth, that day you finally feel 100%, would never have occurred with out Day 1.

Tapered for a few weeks and have been feeling wds. Zeroed out yesterday and took no pills.

I don't think I am your classic 20 year junkie. I have only used opiates (pills) as prescribed or less for chronic pain from degenerative arthritis which, as family genetic tradition dictates, started in feet and is now full body. 3 operations on feet so far. It aint pretty.

Workplace accident in late 2010 left me with two damaged rotator cuffs, two detached and two torn tendons in various parts of my arms and shoulders, a semi fucked up neck and constantly in acute pain. 

This lead to increased opiate use. 

Fours and a half years and two shoulder operations later the arms and shoulders are doing somewhat better, though I still have regular pain in them, especially in cold weather. 

After my last shoulder/arm
operation the 'acute pain' level was reduced significantly and so I reduced my opiate use back to 'chronic pain' levels. Over time and of my own volition so not physically any serious withdrawal problem. Or so I thought. 

Classic severe post opiate reduction induced anxiety and manic depression sets in, (or is that returns?). It took me a while to understand what was happening. Back into the anti anxiety and depression meds.

Recently I decided that, though I may not be an addict in the classic sense of the word, I am definitely a prescribed opiate addict, dependant on them as a coping mechanism for masking pain. And that is an important point pain masking, not pain killing. 

The problem, for me, is that the masking is not just of pain but of other significant components of my neural operations which depend on those same signal pathways. 

Namely empathy. In my case, lack of empathy precedes apathy. I just don't care about anything anymore. Quit caring years ago.

So that is all well and good, I did/do not face many of the problems that dome addicts do in terms of maintaining supply. I had/can have  all the opiates I want really. I have some sitting right over there on my table. They even get paid for by my insurance company.

My physical ailments have not gone away. The chronic pain, while not as acute after the shoulder operations, is still very chronic and real. 

Not taking opiates is revealing to me how much more fucked up I have become physically as I have aged on opiates. I have been waiting it out to see how much is wds aches and pains and which are real persist pains.

The problems for me are that 20 years of various levels of opiate use has left me functioning poorly both mentally, personally and professionally.

Since my life has spin out if control and capsized anyways, I figure I might as well put a bow on it and quit the pills too. 

In short, I find myself up against a mental, emotional, physical, and financial wall. I have ceased normal mental functioning and have gone into a state of numbness.

Tapered for a few weeks and have been feeling wds. Zeroed out yesterday and took no pills.

I don't think I am your classic 20 year junkie. I have only used opiates (pills) as prescribed or less for chronic pain from degenerative arthritis which, as family genetic tradition dictates, started in feet and is now full body. 3 operations on feet so far. It aint pretty.

Workplace accident in late 2010 left me with two damaged rotator cuffs, two detached and two torn tendons in various parts of my arms and shoulders, a semi fucked up neck and constantly in acute pain. 

This lead to increased opiate use. 

Fours and a half years and two shoulder operations later the arms and shoulders are doing somewhat better, though I still have regular pain in them, especially in cold weather. 

After my last shoulder/arm
operation the 'acute pain' level was reduced significantly and so I reduced my opiate use back to 'chronic pain' levels. Over time and of my own volition so not physically any serious withdrawal problem. Or so I thought. 

Classic severe post opiate reduction induced anxiety and manic depression sets in, (or is that returns?). It took me a while to understand what was happening. Back into the anti anxiety and depression meds.

Recently I decided that, though I may not be an addict in the classic sense of the word, I am definitely a prescribed opiate addict, dependant on them as a coping mechanism for masking pain. And that is an important point pain masking, not pain killing. 

The problem, for me, is that the masking is not just of pain but of other significant components of my neural operations which depend on those same signal pathways.

As you all know (well, that is presumptuous. Some of you have followed me and we have chatted over the past year) I have been in pain mgmt for years for disc problems and frequent heavy nerve and muscle pain. 


When I asked my doctor about non-narcotic options they gave me a couple of things to try. One was a pain cream that included gabapentin, baclofen, flexeril, lidocaine, and ketoprofen. Topical cream, for rubbing on muscle knots and spasms. 


I tried it a few times and it did help some. Took the edge off the knots but nothing else, since it isn't systemic medicine. 


At a follow up, I asked about oral options for non-narcotics and was given two different medications. One is baclofen (10mg) to be taken in very small doses for knots/spasms. The other is 100mg gabapentin to be taken 3x per day. 


I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and despite my dr saying not to worry, I am scared of the baclofen messing with my seizure threshold since I take an antidepressant (wellbutrin) that can also make one prone to seizures. 


I also haven't been having any knots lately so I have not yet tried the baclofen. 


Gabapentin is for the pinched nerves and the dr said the dose is so low it probably won't do anything but we can raise it over time if I tolerate it. But he warned that it can cause suicidal thoughts and impulses. That obviously set off my anxiety pretty hardcore and I've been scared to try it. 


So my question is for other folks who are handling nerve pain and may have experience with gabapentin/neurontin. 


Did it cause any weird psychological problems for you, like suicidal ideation? After studying the medication, I think it has a good chance of helping my nerve pain once I am on a higher dose. But I already have a long family history of suicide, and myself suffer from light depression. 


I guess I'm just checking in with my recovery reddit friends to see if anybody has any history with this medication. I know it isn't exactly recovery related, but remember that the reason I asked for something non-narcotic was due to wanting to avoid the monthly cycle of dependence. I've done lots of injections and procedures but still have pain issues and if I am going to succeed in staying off opiates, finding an alternative medical path is vital.

I just wanted to post that I'm still going strong on the subs and haven't used for i think a good month and a half, two months or so. Also haven't been drinking. I went home to visit my mom for two weeks, just got back tonight. Unlike all the other times I went home I didn't stay numb drunk the whole time I was home. This time was different. I stayed active. Visited a lot of old friends. Went to some parties and stayed sober. I did drink once but it was with family members and legitimately was a great time. Still, have no interest in continuing to drink though now I'm back to my normal gig. I'm back out in Alberta for the holidays and have to work through christmas and new years. I have spent christmas alone for quite a few years now and I'm pretty used to it though it always was a time I would use heavily and drink. This year I am volunteering at a seniors palliative care wing at the hospital in the town I live in. After work on the 24th, 25th, 26th I'm going to visit an elderly man who doesn't have any family or friends. I don't know how that is going to go but honestly I feel good about having a place to go and hangout and hopefully it will help this man (I'll withhold his name) too. 
All around things have been going quite well. I've reconnected with a few people and made some acquaintances with people who are around my age and who like to skateboard. On night shift at my place of employment I've been putting together boxes and rails to skate and now these people and I have a place to skate during the winter. We found an empty sort of huge hall/kazeebo type structure that is paved underneath the roof. Its not used during the winter so we have free range of it and have populated it with these personal construction projects of mine. I try to go there everyday to skate for fun and exercise. It gives my days off more purpose and I'm getting back my shredding skills slowly lol. I hope these acquaintances end up being positive friendships, even if its just to skateboard with someone once in a while. It would be the first time in years that I have made new friendships that do not revolve around drugs. 
Another good change I have made is that I set myself up with a decent vaporizer as an alternative to smoking. My pack-and-a-half-a-day smoking habit has dropped dramatically. Over the last three weeks I've bought three packs of cigarettes and I'm gonna try and not have any cigarettes at all tomorrow. My lungs feel significantly better. My throat feels better. I can sing somewhat again and have been learning a lot of songs on guitar and writing songs again like I used to. Its a huge boost to my confidence which tends to hover around the negative 500 percentile range most days. Might now be consistently staying like negative 475 percent so thats an improvement haha! 
I still have bad days. Well days that I wake up in a depressed state of mind that seems to grow all day and I just can't seem to shake it or think my way into a fresher perspective like I've been working on how to do. By the time the sun goes down and I'm back at my apartment for the night I can be pretty low. Saddening thoughts and memories and regrets and darkly-inspired potential realities take on a sort of momentum through out the day that seems to only have one direction. These vectors of depression can get the best of me at times. I try to really just hold out in a simple ""this too shall pass"" sort of white-knuckled way and hope tomorrow when I wake up I'll feel better. Its nights like that where I wish I had more friends to turn to or maybe a partner for support. And maybe those things will also come in time but for now, its just me a lot of the time I have to be strong and ok with that. I try not to let any single moment overwhelm me. But you all know how hard that can be. Things can look...very bleak the further you try and see them stretch into the future. Like I have mentioned before, in these moments I turn to my ferret comrade and we hang out and make it through another night like bosses. 
Anyway, I just was in a highly reflective mood and wanted to write out some accomplishments I've made to maybe try and put into perspective what I've done and what I still have to do. 
Oh, I should mention that I'm still doing the weekly spot urine tests. They are working as far as I can see and if it is something someone else thinks might help them stay on track with a maintenance program then I recommend it. And I haven't while vacationing back in NB, but before I left I was making it to a weekly NA meeting. They sometimes are a really positive experience and sometimes they aren't but usually I'm glad to have gone.

I hope everyone out there is doing good. No matter what time of the year it is, I hope people are feeling better than they did the day before if only by the virtue of making it through to the next one-- that next installment of our ongoing lives being the latest opportunity to make whatever changes we have to in order to be happy like we deserve to be.

I was pretty confused at the time and had just gotten new glasses so I stopped wearing them thinking they were jacked.  But, I also went back to H.  The beginning of May I went and got on a Suboxone program which ended being the worst thing ever.  My joints started hurting so bad.  I almost would cry when trying to roll over at night.

So besides all the shitty wd symptoms I see double.  This is making it so my SO has to drive me everywhere as I can't tell which strip is the right one for my lane.  Like there are two sets of strips on each side of me.  Anyone else have this?  Any clue when it will go away.  It sure is making recovery a ton harder when I can't be independent.  Makes me want to dose all the time since no matter what I do I can't escape the symptom unless I get totally fucked to fall asleep.  Been successfully using combinations DXM, Xanax, Ambien to sleep.

Everyone here is so helpful.  I have been reading posts all week trying to learn from them as well.  It has been a great help with the mental side of things.

Since Tues the 4th my Dr. has been doing IV nutrients and Amino Acid thearpy, today being the first day without IV.  I will get more tomorrow though.  So besides all the shitty wd symptoms I see double.  This is making it so my SO has to drive me everywhere as I can't tell which strip is the right one for my lane.  Like there are two sets of strips on each side of me.  Anyone else have this?  Any clue when it will go away.  It sure is making recovery a ton harder when I can't be independent.  Makes me want to dose all the time since no matter what I do I can't escape the symptom unless I get totally fucked to fall asleep.  Been successfully using combinations DXM, Xanax, Ambien to sleep.

Everyone here is so helpful.  I have been reading posts all week trying to learn from them as well.  It has been a great help with the mental side of things.  I want to go give NA a try but this lack of driving makes that one tough as I am pretty far from any meetings or even bus stops.  Anyone have any idea when I can hope to see again?",1.0,all so I'm 85 days clean today and I,,,,

Anyone experience this before?","Long Post, no TLDR, but it's kinda interesting I think. I'd love it if people at least skimmed it and gave me their thoughts.

I have no idea how long I haven't been using heroin for. Based on my posting history, I think I quit 22 days ago because I remember posting asking about how long after taking ReVia I could use dope (the answer being if you take one 50mg ReVia pill you can't get high for 4-5 days, and I made that post 4-5 days after I had taken one pill and that and the following day were the last days I used.

I've been taking ReVia (25 or 50 mgs) daily and I think that shit is really helping me out with cravings and staying clean, I highly recommend getting a script for it if you can afford it. 

I've been smoking a decent amount of hash and cigarettes recently though. And trying to find highs elsewhere, like trying out mdma again after not having done it for years and doing some coke the other week for no good reason. 

I'd been taking xanax i bought illegally (some of it was real pharma stuff, some the fake pressed alprazolam shipped from india that contains barely any of the shit) and tbh I never got high from it, but I always looked forward to taking it, and always felt happy imagining myself getting high when taking it, even though I knew that my tolerance to benzos was too high and that even when it wasn't high I would never get high off it (it seems that I'm not a particularly anxious person except when in withdrawal, when taking it did help take the edge off a bit).


So I'm still addicted to taking something, and having my clonazepam script and being able to take that every day as I taper down - regardless of whether it really is doing anything strong to me - is something I like. Knowing that I can go out and smoke a cigarette and/or hash and doing it most days even though a hash high is shit next to smack gives me pleasure.


How does one get rid of the psychological addiction to just taking ""something""?

I'm not physically addicted to anything anymore except benzos which I'm not abusing (I'm actually taking them as needed and not more than my daily dose), and I just seem to be looking for something, be it cocaine, or maybe a few (3-4) drinks, some hash, or a cigarette here and there to have at least once a day.

Does this go away if you're clean from everything for long enough (90 days being the first big milestone)?

I'm not too worried about relapsing on heroin because I'm being supervised when taking my ReVia every day by my gf (she checks under my tongue and all around my mouth, then gives me a kiss) and I've had little to no cravings for it or alcohol which are the two drugs I've abused in the past, but this addiction to taking something - anything really, just doing some form of abuse even if it produces little to no body or mental high - is really tripping me up.

You've seen the news headlines ""Drug addict ODs with children in the car"" Drug addict robs pharmacy"" etc etc. 

God awful things that people do in terrible situations. Either out if ignorance, or desperation. 

The addict stigma is, for lack of a better word, shit. We are taught in our society to not generalize, to not stereotype. With exception to the addict demographic. 

I indirectly announced my recovery yesterday on a popular social media site that I frequent often to prove a point. Friends and family members discovered my past addiction. What inspired this was what inspired this very post I am writing:

Reading a news channels post about an opiate overdose. Scrolling through the comments I see multiple friends comment something along the lines of ""they're wastes of space. Let them die, we are better off with out them.""

I suddenly felt sick to my stomach. Such lack of empathy. This addict has a story. This addict has a family. Is somones mother, daughter, sister and friend! You WISH death upon them like some holier than thou make shift grim reaper? From your self righteous throne behind a smart phone screen? 

I wrote in a post how everyone unknowingly loves an addict. How if their loved one had an addiction that they were unaware of, would they wish death on them? Would they call them scum? How I am a recovering addict and if they found out that I had an overdose would you mourn my death or celebrate? I wish the majority of society would have some damn perspective. How would they expect a loved one to come forward for help? 

No one truly understands the dire straights of an addiction unless they lived through one. If more people spoke out about their past addictions and recovery maybe then those passing judgement would gain perspective. 

Not all addicts are criminals. Not all addicts are bad parents. Addicts do not start out wanting an addiction, and a majority of addicts drug dealers are licensed professionals who swore an oath to treat them. That's how my addiction originated, a legal prescription. 

We are not bad people. Addicts are sick. They require treatment like any patient with a terminal disease and should be treated like such.

Goddamn you feelings, there are so many more of you than I remember. 

I'll start by saying that rehab was actually amazing. If you're fighting this addiction and you have the means, I highly recommend it. I was one of those people who was so hell bent on proving I could do it on my own that I rejected the idea of rehab for months...now I wish I could go slap my past self in the face. If I had just accepted the help that was there earlier, I would have saved myself so much time. It was such a wonderful opportunity to just take a month off of my life and work on improving myself in safety. I got to meet people in there that I never would have otherwise, and form some really fascinating relationships (forming new relationships is definitely something that I stopped doing entirely in active addiction, so to just make new friends was such a blessing). I learned a lot about my disease. Almost all of the counselors and RAs there were recovering addicts, so there was a whole staff of people who had been where I was, and there were so many people to turn to during the millions of emotional upheavals I went through there. I feel like I grew more as a person there in 5 weeks than I had in the past couple years of progressive addiction. 

And now I'm out in society again and I kind of wish I could just go running back to rehab. You do so much critical work on yourself in there, but it's true, the real work starts when you get out, and all of a sudden I'm just not feeling up to it anymore. See, I was one of those functional junkies when I was active. I was living on my own, renting a beautiful house. I had a car, a cat, a boyfriend. I paid my bills. I had a job that my boss said he'd be happy to have me back at when I got out. I mean, I was fucking miserable, and every day was a struggle, but I kept my shit together pretty well all things considered. But in rehab it was decided, by others and then eventually by me, that it would be a terrible idea for me to move back home. So despite how hard I worked to keep it all together, I am actually losing everything as a result of my addiction. 

Now I'm sitting in my parents house, thousands of miles from what I consider home, with nothing to show for myself, having to start totally from scratch. I'm in a state that I haven't lived in for nine years, that I had no intention of ever living in again, where I don't know anyone worth knowing besides my family. My parents are (with my consent) holding all the money I had left when I came back home, so I have to be driven everywhere and given permission to do anything. I agreed to move into a sober living house close to where I went to rehab at the end of January, where at least I'll be back in a recovery community with people who understand what's going on with me, but holy fuck I just want to go home. I don't think I realized when I made the decision to come back to my family and ask for help just how much I'd be losing. I worked so hard to keep everything together for so long, to keep my life together with some semblance of autonomy and independence, and even when my addiction was at it's worst I was still succeeding with that. Now I'm here, and I have my sobriety and my recovery, but absolutely nothing else, and I'm almost wondering if I wasn't better off before. 

I realize a lot of this is PAWS. I'm really grateful I learned so much about that recently, because if I didn't know what it was I'd probably just think that I was going crazy. I am also grateful that I'm in a safe place, thousands of miles away from my habit with no easy connects, because there have been a couple of times in the past week that I felt like I would have done anything to feel different from than the way I was then. I managed to push through that, sober and frustrated. But the PAWS, exacerbated by shitty life circumstances, are really kicking my ass. There's the depression, the irritability, the lack of energy, but the worst of it is how fucking dumb it's making me. I'm a pretty intelligent person, and right now I'm struggling to solve the simplest problems. It's this perfect storm of clusterfuck in my head, and I don't know how to move forward, or what to do with my fucking self. 

I am going for Ibogaine treatment in Mexico in a couple of weeks, thanks to my immensely supportive parents. I'm hoping that since I'll be nearly 60 days clean when I go in and won't be using it for detox, that it'll help a lot with the PAWS over the next couple of months and help me get my head back on straight to actually make the responsible decisions that I know I have to make now. I'm not looking at it as a magic bullet by any means, but I know that right now I need some serious fucking help that I'm just not finding in the sub par programs and meetings outside of rehab. I'm also trying to take it one day at a time, since there's really not that much that I can do to put my life back together before I go to mexico anyway, but that's never really been my jam. 

So yeah, if you read all that, bless your heart. Just sitting here trying to not hate myself for the mess I've caused. So many people have forgiven me so much already, and I'll forgive anyone almost anything but... someone asked me ""what would you do to someone who did the things you did to yourself to your brother?"" and I said ""I'd shoot them in the fucking face."" That self forgiveness thing is a bitch, huh?

I am trying to get clean from about 3 years of oxy30 use, using around 120-150 (up to 240mg) per day with hardly any breaks (3 or 4 days once in a while with the help of suboxone).  Every time I thought I had a breakthrough or thought I was sick of chasing these damn pills I somehow ended back using again when money came my way.  Here I am again with no money no blues and am desperate to finally make this recovery stick.   

I guess I have a few questions about using subs and kratom together-I have 1 8mg sub and plenty of kratom from an online vendor I got a while ago but didn't use much of.  Is it ok to use both together?  Or is it better to use one before the other or should I only use one method?  

2 weeks ago I took the week off work to detox and used subs for 5 days-I was happy because the detox seemed to be going well but when Friday came I grabbed some 30s and haven't looked back-now it has been over a week of using again.  The sub detox 2 weeks ago wasn't bad at all but now I am back at work and can't really take anymore time off.

Alright, Day 10. That means I'm pretty much out the woods, the oxycodone is all out my system. Withdrawal symptoms are minimal due to the help of RX'd colonidine 3x a day -- which I also exceeded(I was told to not take over 4, I *think* I took 6-8....and fucking blacked out like a stupid compulsive fucking junkie and could of killed myself/others if I was driving. But that's ok, remembering our own ignorance is good right? First 3 days weren't too bad....after that **---!!!!DEPRESSION!!!---** for a solid 2 days. God damn was I a fuckin downer. On Monday I felt ""normal"" 



As goes with the Adderall(10mg/3x/day), im reeaaally not a stim DOC guy, so how I'm reacting is pretty much.... im feeling not too fuckin bad considering my bill of health...I feel pretty normal. I function much better, I react less emotionally and more logical, im more self aware, I'm calling out my impulsive behaviors, I also have a refill ready to drop and im not fixating on that magical fill date like I use to. I seriously believe I've been un-diagosed with ADHD or something of the likes and should of been taking this stuff in elementary school. If not, then this shit has been a great tool(not toy) for me to get where I am right now. 


It seems my addiction has [mentally/subconsciously] blown my chronic inflammatory disease pain way out of proportion. Don't get me wrong, this week I've been paying close attention to my body and I DO have pain....just not nearly as bad when I was loaded up on oxycodone. I think analgesia has to blame for this, but regardless that's beside the fact. I have found out I can focus on other things and just make my pain fade away...best way I can explain it is it feels like a static interference towards the annoyance/discomfort/pain. Also realized my pain is different every day, completely subjective to my mood and how I'm perceiving shit at the moment. Telling yourself,  ""you're having a good fuckin day tomorrow no matter what,"" and waking up the next day feeling completely different worked for me. You do have a choice to be happy, sounds corny but it's true. 

This is also not my first rode with sobriety(about 8 years ago) so I happen to have some good literature on hand and have been utilizing my ""Just for Today"", ""Keep It Simple"", and the good ol black book(NA). I've been neglecting to journal....I've got a nice leather journal my wife bought me to use, but I prefer this outlet. I wanna save that journal for some more...positive things I could use it for. Biggest thing that got to me today that I'm a bit upset at myself about is I let my cravings for meds dictate my emotions, and they were the most negative around my spouse. I had a flare up in my usual areas(worst ive had yet) and I was just so fucking frustrated/panicked I couldn't do anything about my pain(as in take my DOC). I basically fucked up date night with my horrible attitude and letting my craving/frustration dictate my mood in such a cancerous way.

Thank you all so much for your replies last time I posted. I have read them many times. 

Tl;dr of my first post: husband confessed he'd been addicted to opiates since before we got married, I had zero clue. He goes to a clinic, on Zubsolv. He's been off about five months, we have a one year old. 

I am really trying you guys but I just don't know. A month before he came clean and stopped, I quit drinking alcohol. So I can totally relate to the addiction issues he has and we have had good talks. But I'm still his only support. That's too much for me. I've told him this, told him about this group, told him why having support is so important to me with quitting drinking. 

He has told me every day is a struggle and he thinks about getting high. He says they don't really talk about anything at his therapy. He said he'd consider seeing a different therapist but he hasn't done so yet. He had mentioned working with his therapist on his anger issues but has not. In the past month he's cracked a kitchen cabinet punching it and snapped a steak knife in half in anger, that I know of. 

On the flipside, he is starting to sometimes notice when he is getting angry and tells me he needs to go calm down, and then I will sometimes get an apology. That's the bit of progress I've been holding on to. He's current on all his bills and has put a bit into savings. He's been a lot better about asking if I need any help around the house. There has been some progress. 

But I don't feel very connected. I saw this as a great opportunity for us to reconnect, sober. At first he was into it, we'd plug in and watch a movie or play a game. But now I can't get him to put his phone down and he just used some of his saved money to buy an old laptop so last night he wouldn't stop looking at the laptop for me to be able to talk to him at all. We haven't had sex in at least six months. He says he wants to but sober sex makes him too nervous.

I still don't really trust him. In my head, when he's being nice to me I start to think maybe he's using again and trying to deflect. I know trust takes time. I try not to dwell on these thoughts because I do know he's not using. 

I'm no peach all the time, I know it's not going to be sunshine and rainbows. I said I wanted to go to couples therapy again but he was not into that idea and I haven't pushed it. Maybe I should be pushing that more. 

I wish I could just see the future and know what the right thing to do is. At this point I don't think he is taking recovery seriously enough, if I'm being honest. When I asked him about going off the Zubsolv (I know this takes time, I was more asking about if he's working on a plan or anything), he said he'll do it when the doctor at the clinic says he should. The doctor suggested he go on anti-depressants but he doesn't want to because he's scared he will feel not like himself. I'm trying to do my own thing and let him figure out his own recovery and just worry about what I'm doing but how can I not be concerned? I try to let those thoughts just pass but every couple weeks it's like I just totally break down. How long can I just keep saying have faith have faith have faith? Is the problem all with me being too invested? Are we just not good for each other? Maybe we are both holding the other one back. 

I guess I'm hoping someone has some perspective for me again. I feel like I still can't figure out which way is up. Thanks you guys and best wishes to all of you.

Tl;dr of my first post: husband confessed he'd been addicted to opiates since before we got married, I had zero clue. He goes to a clinic, on Zubsolv. He's been off about five months, we have a one year old. 

I am really trying you guys but I just don't know. A month before he came clean and stopped, I quit drinking alcohol. So I can totally relate to the addiction issues he has and we have had good talks. But I'm still his only support. That's too much for me. I've told him this, told him about this group, told him why having support is so important to me with quitting drinking. 

He has told me every day is a struggle and he thinks about getting high. He says they don't really talk about anything at his therapy. He said he'd consider seeing a different therapist but he hasn't done so yet. He had mentioned working with his therapist on his anger issues but has not. In the past month he's cracked a kitchen cabinet punching it and snapped a steak knife in half in anger, that I know of. 

On the flipside, he is starting to sometimes notice when he is getting angry and tells me he needs to go calm down, and then I will sometimes get an apology. That's the bit of progress I've been holding on to. He's current on all his bills and has put a bit into savings. He's been a lot better about asking if I need any help around the house. There has been some progress. 

But I don't feel very connected. I saw this as a great opportunity for us to reconnect, sober. At first he was into it, we'd plug in and watch a movie or play a game.

3 or so years ago, I started having knee pain. Went from being a 10+ mile a week runner to never running due to the pain. I had some left over hydro 5s from a root canal I'd use. Never to get high, just to not hurt. They worked. Then one day they didn't. I looked up online and saw they made 10mg pills, so I figured two was safe. That night was my metaphorical dragon I spent the last 3 years chasing. I vividly remember wearing some basketball shorts, and loving how they felt against my legs. That was the euphoria I was looking for. 

Went to primary care for my knees; they gave me tramodol. Sort of filled the hole, but not really, and played heavily with my emotions. Went to a knee doctor, spent about 1.5 years bouncing between old pills, trams, physical therapy, etc. I got a steady supply of hydro again after my knee surgery. When that ran out, I went to a pain management doctor, who was happy to write me 180 pills, at 7.5mg, every 30 days. 

The first time I ran out was July 4th. Had been on the steady scripts for about 6 months, and was just barely getting by with the typical cycle of binge for 20 days, try and make the pills last the last 10, refill early, beg pills from others, etc. 

My first WD wasn't bad by anyone's standards. I was sick for about 3 days, not terrible, just runs and aches, insomnia and blahs. Day 4 I heard a song on the radio and starting singing with it, and it was like the lights came back on in the world. No lingering anything. 

My next pain management visit i told him I was off. He wrote me the scripts just in case, as we were trying a new injection for my knee, but he wanted me to be ok if it didn't work. It didn't work. I lasted about 35 days with no pills, but was in school one night and my knees hurt so bad I couldn't think, so I took 1/2 pill. 

I've spent the last 6 months or so telling myself ""this is the script you're going to taper down on, so you can quit without being miserable"". And you all know how that goes. Laying in bed asking yourself why you took 10 pills today when the goal was 6. Why you've done this for the last week now. Lying to yourself about how you're going to stretch those last 20 pills over 15 days, just to keep the WD away. 

Day 2. I'm getting off easy. I have the runs. My body hurts. I took NyQuil and Benadryl and melatonin and still only got 3 hours of sleep last night. But I don't have that sadness, that listlessness that I had last time, and that's how I know this is the last time I'm doing this to myself. I have a pain pill that's not an opiate that works for me. I might even try and work tomorrow. I'm about 48 hours right now from my last dose, and I actually feel 100% better than I deserve to. I didn't buy black market pills, or jump to harder stuff. I didn't lose my house or my job or my kids or my wife. I'm even getting an easy WD, all things considered. Don't get me wrong, I'm craving. I know that there's a loved one with a regular supply I could call and ask pills from, and he'd not only give them to me but would drive them here so I don't have to suffer. Not his fault, he's an amazing man and just doesn't want to see his little boy in pain. But I'm not making that call. I know that I can refill my script in like 3 days. But I'm not. I spent so much of my time just trying to talk myself out of taking pills. So much of my time resenting my choices. This is not the man I chose to be for my wife and kids. 

Mostly writing this as a goodby to the ""easy way"". When my wife and I were fighting, it was easy to just take a few pills and go do the laundry. It made me more patient. But I know I have that patience in me, without the help of pills that control me. This is my day 2, and I'm thankful I'm getting out before I lose it all.

I got myself some kratom from a local tobacco shop yesterday afternoon.  Took 2 grams as soon as I got in my car and went straight to yoga.  That helped immensely and I would like to thank all of you that suggested it. I took 300mg of gabapentin and some seroquel (take daily) and slept like a baby for 8 hours.

My physical symptoms are much better.  I get some flashes of too hot or too cold, but at least not at the same time.  My face still kinda feels like it's layered in sand, especially where I have facial hair, but that's decreasing as well.  I can also sit without having to move or or try really hard to stay still.  My anxiety is quite lower and I know that I will make it through this.

I'm starting to feel those psychological effects.  Specifically, I feel very empty.  Like there is nothing.  I just ride around faking it to make it.  Fake smiles, fake interest in conversations, fake excitement to do something.  It's what I've done when in deep depressive states and what usually pulls me out.  I've learned that I have to force myself to allow me the opportunity to find pleasure.  Do NOT fall in the pit of self-pity and finding empathy in misery.  That's how you lose.

I'm also finding good in this experience.  I like to think that you can learn from anything, and this has really taught me to respect drugs, and have empathy for addicts.

I had some PST prepped and in the fridge in case I needed it and could not handle the WDs to tie me over til I can get into a detox.  I also had about 3 lbs of seeds left in the pantry.  I just returned home from watching the movie [The Exception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4721124/) (very good, and I'm not into that type of movie).  It's kind of an emotional movie and at the end I felt a wave of emotions that are uncomfortable.  I immediately thought of the PST at home.

I got myself some kratom from a local tobacco shop yesterday afternoon.  Took 2 grams as soon as I got in my car and went straight to yoga.  That helped immensely and I would like to thank all of you that suggested it. I took 300mg of gabapentin and some seroquel (take daily) and slept like a baby for 8 hours.

My physical symptoms are much better.  I get some flashes of too hot or too cold, but at least not at the same time.  My face still kinda feels like it's layered in sand, especially where I have facial hair, but that's decreasing as well.  I can also sit without having to move or or try really hard to stay still.  My anxiety is quite lower and I know that I will make it through this.

I'm starting to feel those psychological effects.  Specifically, I feel very empty.  Like there is nothing.  I just ride around faking it to make it.  Fake smiles, fake interest in conversations, fake excitement to do something.  It's what I've done when in deep depressive states and what usually pulls me out.  I've learned that I have to force myself to allow me the opportunity to find pleasure.  Do NOT fall in the pit of self-pity and finding empathy in misery.  That's how you lose.

I'm also finding good in this experience.  I like to think that you can learn from anything, and this has really taught me to respect drugs, and have empathy for addicts.

I had some PST prepped and in the fridge in case I needed it and could not handle the WDs to tie me over til I can get into a detox.  I also had about 3 lbs of seeds left in the pantry.  I just returned home from watching the movie [The Exception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4721124/) (very good, and I'm not into that type of movie).  It's kind of an emotional movie and at the end I felt a wave of emotions that are uncomfortable.  I immediately thought of the PST at home.  So, as soon as I walked in the door, I went straight to the fridge, got that bottle, and poured i down the drain.  Got the seeds out of the fridge and threw them straight in the trash outside.  I'm done with that shit.

I'm doing so well in every aspect of my life in these two weeks on suboxone, and I've been so happy. I'm so content and well adjusted to life without h, which I never thought was possible. It's basically a breeze from here on out, if only I had the *desire* to stop doing h, but I just don't. I don't know what's wrong with me...  

I went from a half g /day of tar, to two weeks later, taking 1-3 mg of subs every 24-36 hours or so. And I'm so much happier. I know 100% that if I wanted continue sobriety, I could easily. But *I just don't want to*. What is wrong with me? What do I do?  

Also, one more question:  

Has anyone ever quit heroin by going down slowly from h to roxies to tabs? Or  something similar to what I've described?

Through educating myself about the recovery process, I know and understand that there are many steps to make in order to achieve this. But I have a few questions. 

1. At what point is an addict truly recovered?
2. What next?

I expect my recovery to be a long and winding road, hopefully with not too many bumps in it ;) When does the road end? Am I left to live in the midst of an internal abyss with no end? A purgatory? Perpetual limbo? The suspense of what is to come is a little maddening, but I'm optimistic. Which is a rarity for me! I'm a negative Nancy. 


Will my life always require some level of maintenance?
 I must admit, I have experienced very little in the cravings department. Not using drugs is a shockingly easy task at hand, one of which I have failed countless times before. I recall late night binges, bumping pill after pill after pill. I'd find myself with 1 or 2 left. I would tell myself that I would save them for the morning, so I can start my day right. Who needs a morning cup of joe when you can snort a Percocet or two!? Plus I wouldn't be sick. It would make my morning hustle to get money a bit easier. 

....I'd never save them. I'd always cave. I'd tell myself I will get up earlier. Ill call my dad. Ill ask my brother. Ill cash in beer cans. I am my own biggest obstacle. We as addicts are master manipulators, and I routinely pulled a fast one on myself. 

I also remind myself that I have only seen the tip of the iceberg in the PAWS department. So I remain vigilant yet cautiously optimistic. 

I find myself with so much free time. I would spend the majority of my day, when trying to re up, scheming to get money or trying to find a connect that isn't dry. Then using all day. From sun up until I pass out. 

Any minuscule amount of free time is saying something because I'm a mother. I work. I cook. I clean. I do yoga. I occasionally see a girlfriend of mine, who I will refer to as Couscous.  I was once very much into yoga, so much I would teach private sessions. I started practicing again. When I am home, all I want to do is clean. The longest I am able to sit in one spot is while I change the babies diaper or while I sit here and type this. 

I feel like addiction is a toxic relationship.  Sure, you think you're in love. You think they're good for you. You think you can make it work, no matter how hard things get. But from the outside you see the strain it is having on your wellbeing, finances, happiness and health. 

So what's next? What will my future bring? I can guarantee any relapse will end my relationship and will ruin my life. Will my sobriety become easier? Am I still an addict?

Despite the uncertainty of tomorrow I will continue counting my days of sobriety. 

Despite my unanswered questions I will push forward, one day at a time, and treat each tomorrow I awake to as a mini Motel Victory.

Through educating myself about the recovery process, I know and understand that there are many steps to make in order to achieve this. But I have a few questions. 

1. At what point is an addict truly recovered?
2. What next?

I expect my recovery to be a long and winding road, hopefully with not too many bumps in it ;) When does the road end? Am I left to live in the midst of an internal abyss with no end? A purgatory? Perpetual limbo? The suspense of what is to come is a little maddening, but I'm optimistic. Which is a rarity for me! I'm a negative Nancy. 


Will my life always require some level of maintenance?
 I must admit, I have experienced very little in the cravings department. Not using drugs is a shockingly easy task at hand, one of which I have failed countless times before. I recall late night binges, bumping pill after pill after pill. I'd find myself with 1 or 2 left. I would tell myself that I would save them for the morning, so I can start my day right. Who needs a morning cup of joe when you can snort a Percocet or two!? Plus I wouldn't be sick. It would make my morning hustle to get money a bit easier. 

....I'd never save them. I'd always cave. I'd tell myself I will get up earlier. Ill call my dad. Ill ask my brother. Ill cash in beer cans. I am my own biggest obstacle. We as addicts are master manipulators, and I routinely pulled a fast one on myself. 

I also remind myself that I have only seen the tip of the iceberg in the PAWS department. So I remain vigilant yet cautiously optimistic. 

I find myself with so much free time. I would spend the majority of my day, when trying to re up, scheming to get money or trying to find a connect that isn't dry. Then using all day. From sun up until I pass out. 

Any minuscule amount of free time is saying something because I'm a mother. I work. I cook. I clean. I do yoga. I occasionally see a girlfriend of mine, who I will refer to as Couscous.  I was once very much into yoga, so much I would teach private sessions. I started practicing again. When I am home, all I want to do is clean. The longest I am able to sit in one spot is while I change the babies diaper or while I sit here and type this. 

I feel like addiction is a toxic relationship.  Sure, you think you're in love. You think they're good for you. You think you can make it work, no matter how hard things get. But from the outside you see the strain it is having on your wellbeing, finances, happiness and health. 

So what's next? What will my future bring? I can guarantee any relapse will end my relationship and will ruin my life. Will my sobriety become easier? Am I still an addict?

Despite the uncertainty of tomorrow I will continue counting my days of sobriety. 

Despite my unanswered questions I will push forward, one day at a time, and treat each tomorrow I awake to as a mini Motel Victory.

My last dose of oxycodone was 3/30/13, I started the bup on 4/1/13, I have been on it for months. I tried getting off of it in late July, shortly before my son was born, but my depression came back hard with lots of cravings, so I jumped back up to ~12 mg/day, which was still down from the 16 mg/day I had been on. I've had severe gastric problems my entire time of bup and really the entire time I was taking oxy and doing assorted other drugs. I was down to 0.5 mg/day of bup and today was my first day with none. I am so depressed. Everything seems to be piling up. I love my wife and my son more than I could every describe, yet, despite all my love for them, I am having a very tough time loving myself; consequently, I find myself often not unwilling, but simply not wanting to deal with her or our son. We've been sleeping apart due to my extreme sleep disturbances and she will come in the morning to get my help with our boy. I love his morning smiles, I love his cooing, yet when she asks me to help I dread it. I wake up in the morning hurting, tired, angry, depressed. Often times that will go away once I get up and get moving, so long as what I'm doing is something I want to be doing and that involves physical labor. 

I left medical school for a number of reasons, my addiction being a part of that. I was doing fine for months largely due to the high doses of buprenorphine, but the past few weeks have been rough. The past few days even rougher. Today was yet even more. I desperately want to get high. I desperately want to feel that warm, fuzzy, happiness of the opiate rush come over me. I got introduced to opiates to help treat my migraines, occasionally using it recreational. I also used recreational with friends. Last October/November I entered a deep depression and was sick and tired of every antidepressant, mood stabilizer, and other remedy failing. I managed to find a supply of oxy and started small, but quickly was taking 210-300 mg/per day and it made me feel better for awhile, numbing me to the pain I feel so often in my back, neck, and head, as well as the emotional pain. 

I'm really lost right now. I almost started looking for another source tonight. I really feel like I could slip at any moment. I plan on starting to go to more meetings again, but am hoping for some advice and/or reassurance.

Can anyone tell me something that can help with this? Anything they've done to help fight the cravings, fight the depression?

Is this depression that seems to be coming on from the reduction in bup going to go away? How long did it take? I know my situation (having a pretty severe mental illness to begin with) makes things a little different, but I just want to know whether this could be a contributing factor.

Hell, I could use some words of encouragement, a slap in the face, cold water thrown on me, whatever might help me right now.

Got a mixed response due to tapering with hydrocodone, so I didn't really come back. I got clean, and started going to a therapist to work thru some personal issues. We dealt with my addiction but it was mostly about processing being sexually abused as a kid and my bisexuality, I'm a guy. I feel these two things helped lead me to opiate dependency.

Anyway, at the urging of my therapist I started going to NA meetings. I've done NA before, when it was court ordered and I didn't like it, so maybe I went in with preconceived notions. Anyway, I went with a friend to some meeting and stopped going after a handful. I never shared, I never worked steps, I never sought a sponsor. It felt like BS to me.

I had a small relapse in early June. I used for about a week, realized how stupid I was after the first trip to the pawnshop again, and went back to meetings. I shared this time, and I told my full story. It felt good, and I got some numbers of some people that helped. One was a guy, let's call him Steve, who I felt might make a good sponsor since he was fairly far along in his recovery. We started hanging out, going to meetings together. Life was good.

Well Steve reveled to me he was also bisexual and had been thru a lot of similar events in his life. A little background, I'm out and I know I'm bi, whether caused by sexual abuse or not it's what I am and I accept it. I've never planned on dating a guy, I've just never been interested in it. Well Steve and I started dating I suppose you could say, even though we only did the same shit I'd do withy straight friends, we were also fucking around. Now, I had been warned about dating another addict but Steve and I weren't dating and I knew better, like always.

About a week after we first hooked up Steve confessed to me he wasn't as clean as he lead on in NA. He still used occasionally. He was an IV heroin user, and shot about once a week and used about twice a week.

I'm sure everyone reading this can see where I'm going here. Even though oxy took me to the deepest trenches, I never shot, and I only did dope when absolutely necessary. After I found this that changed. I let him shoot me up, stupidly, for the first time in my life. I loved it, but I was way to afraid of showing track marks and being found out. But, for the first time in my life I was with a guy that I could see myself dating.

I used when he used, not more than two or three times a week, for the next couple of weeks. I don't know if it was the drugs, or finally feeling 100% accepted by someone, but I'm pretty sure Steve is the first person I ever loved. I'm 27, and I've had lots of girlfriend whom I felt I loved. Even one I used with regularity, but what we had was different.

I went away for a week in early July and when I came back Steve was in full on addict mode. Everything in my being was telling me run, but I didn't. I followed him down the rabbit hole. What I got was $1500 in debt to a pawnshop, and a little more than a half G a day ECP habit.

Luckily I've only been using everyday for about 3 weeks, but fuck. I'm 24 hours into withdraw and it's tough. I have to say I don't feel as bad, physically, as I did when coming off oxy. But my state of mind is in the trash. I'm not suicidal, but I'm the closest I've been to feeling that depressed again in almost 10 years. I feel like I can't go to NA, because I can't be around other addicts. Of course my therapist is on vacation, but luckily I'll see him Monday afternoon. He doesn't know I've relapsed. I just don't know where to turn.

I liked what I got at NA, I liked sharing my story and meeting people. Asa bisexual though I'm in a unique position of not being able to form a close bond with either sex without the possibility of it turning sexual.

So, I'm reaching out to you, you beautiful redditors, at least for now. If there's ANYONE with a similar experience, please PM. My heads spinning from a lot more than just throwing up right now. I'd really like some advice from anyone that's been in a similar situation.

I'm also curious about Smart recovery, and if you guys think group addiction therapy could be a possible substitute to 12 step. I need something more structured that doesn't allow outside interaction.

I appreciate any advice, I know this is a long post, but it helps me to write when I'm feeling like shit, and I'm desperately looking for some advise here. I know I'm stupid for thinking a relationship with an addict could work. But a bisexual with a history of sexual abuse as a child who also was a recovering opiate addict was just too tempting a life experience to pass up. The most fucked up thing? If I could go back in time I'd do it again, because I was able to share with Steve stuff I hadn't been able to say out loud to anyone, not even professionals because he's the only person I've ever met that understood me completely. My physical withdraw doesn't even feel as bad as it should because the psychological aspect of loosing a person I was that connected with is so severe right now it's killing me.

long time lurker, first time poster on opiatesrecovery.  I used to comment and post a bit on r/opiates.  I guess things have been coming to a ""head"" in the last few days as far as my usage was concerned.  my parents and my girlfriend got involved, more heavily than they have ever been.  I guess I thought I was hiding it.  I guess I thought my usage was ""recreational"" still.  let me tell you, when you're making over $90k/yr and you are constantly broke... when you are literally going to the ATM daily - there's nothing recreational about it.  I had a big long cry session with the gf last night, admitted everything to her.  we're now technically ""broken up"" because I was lying to her for years and she can't trust me, and I totally understand that (although we still live together so I have no idea how that's going to work).  my parents want me to do a 3-5 day detox program and then an outpatient rehab, something along those lines.  I don't know how the detox program will work because of my job, I wouldn't even know where to begin attacking that.  ""hey guys I know I don't have any personal days left for 2013 but I need to go on medical leave for reasons I can't discuss.""  yeah that sounds great.

I'll try to recap without being overly-wordy because I'm sure you guys see ""first posts"" like this all the time, but I've essentially been struggling with opiates for a decade or longer.  started with the usual (vicodin, percocet) and eventually moved onto the stronger stuff.  my first OxyContin kicked my ass, I loved it so much.  my DOC was blues, ie. roxicodone.  I would snort it, my tolerance was up to 6-7 at a time.  that's $200 or more every time I wanted to get high.  lately I was getting curious about and dabbling in ECP / powdered heroin to ""save money"".  pretty sure I was going way too deep down the rabbit hole.  
I haven't enjoyed ANY other type of drug.  we would drink only occasionally, mostly because the gf was a big wino.  I quit smoking years ago.  HATE cocaine, hate weed.  my only DOC was painkillers, so I rationalized it by saying ""why can't i?""  I have friends that get high after work every single day.  why can't I?  I guess I couldn't handle it, I couldn't separate between ""needing it"" and ""wanting it.""  I've been on suboxone for years, so I was replacing my use with subs when I was broke so I didn't withdraw.  I don't think I know how to go on without them.  right now I'm still rationalizing in my head that I have money, so why not just grab some on the way home?

my girlfriend talked to a couple of my friends about it too - which is embarrassing but I guess necessary.  everyone's been cool about it so far, they just want me to get better.  I don't know what I want anymore.  I know I've been hurting everyone I love, and I just don't want them to worry about me anymore.  I need support - I need to know there are others out there just like me, and that you guys have gotten through it too.  does it get easier?  is the ""want"" still there?

2. Detox - Go to detox, obamacare has made it easy to get free healthcare, no hospital should turn you away if you're asking for help. Please of you want help try to go to the Emergency Room detox. 

3. Family - These are the people who love you unconditionally and no matter how much you fucked up they are usually a phone call away YOU ARE NOT ALONE no matter how much you feel you are. 

4. Friends (Good/Bad) - hopefully you haven't burnt all your bridges and the friends you have are ones who don't get high. if you reach out to them they will be there for you anytime they will notice your call and answer when you need them.  if not In the same sense I use my friends who I used to get high with as examples of who I do not want to be like!

ive been seriously addicted to pills since like 2006.  more recently tho, ive been abusing adderall and hydro.  The aderrall doesn't concern me as much as the vicodin.  At least with the adderall, i've done productive stuff instead of being a lazy slob, I could go out shopping (helps with my social anxiety tremendously), clean, etc.  But I love norco and percocet so much, thats the real devil to me.  It just makes me deal with life so much easier and when I take it, its like the world is at peace for an hour or so.

I've done some bad stuff to get it.  I've gone to ER hospitals fakign pain to get scripts.  I am so sorry to all those hospitals and doctors.  They were all there to help real people in need and I wasn't one.  I was faking my condition so I could get high.  I am now going to pay the price with a nasty withdrawal since I refuse to go to the ER's anymore and since my connect has cut me off.  It's time to pay the piper and i'm ready to do it, don't get me wrong.  But.......i'm just so scared.......scared of withdrawal, scared of that pink fog feeling afte withdrawal where I have no direction, no game plan, nothing to guide me.

I'm 30 years old and stil living with mommy and daddy and I have nothing to my name except piles of debt and insecurity issues.  I have almost no friends and ive spent the last few years just playing World of Warcraft and other games.  I try to immerse myself in videogames so I dont have to think about real life.

I thought I was on the right track for a brief time, only a math class away from getting an AA degree and you would think I could do it right, I mean my book was paid for, no bills, my parents pay for everything but I coulddn't even do taht much.

I am so good with computers but I cant even get a fking job at Walmart.

I can't even get a fking bank account cuz im chexsystem and no banks want me cuz of my history.

In societys eyes, i'm probably worthless and thats exactly how I feel.

I'm sorry, but this feels good even just typing this.  I am letting this out into the nether because im tired of bottling it inside and not telling anyone how I really feel.  

I've had to come out on my own, deal with it on my own, deal with my identity, deal with so much shit, I was bullied as a kid my entire middle and high school years for being fat.  In high school I was still in closet but people could tell, I was also a loner, had no friends just computers.

Even after the fact ive said all this, I have to say that I do truly appreciate and love life.  I just hate MINE.  I always fee like im in the wrong body, wrong family, wrong everything.  I feel like I just got a shitty hand dealt to me and ive handled it so wrong.  Made so many wrong choices.

I've treated so many people wrong and I used to blame them, im so good at blaming others but now I realize it really was me all along.  I feel so bad.

I want to be a good person that I know I am on the inside.  I am, well on some days.  But most of the time, im miserable and just a druggie.

Tomorrows my last day on pills then i start the pain and misery of what I already know is gonna be a HIDEOUS withdrawal.  The last 0392305 times I said it would be my last withdrawal but I always end up somehow getting them again.

ive been seriously addicted to pills since like 2006.  more recently tho, ive been abusing adderall and hydro.  The aderrall doesn't concern me as much as the vicodin.  At least with the adderall, i've done productive stuff instead of being a lazy slob, I could go out shopping (helps with my social anxiety tremendously), clean, etc.  But I love norco and percocet so much, thats the real devil to me.  It just makes me deal with life so much easier and when I take it, its like the world is at peace for an hour or so.

I've done some bad stuff to get it.  I've gone to ER hospitals fakign pain to get scripts.  I am so sorry to all those hospitals and doctors.  They were all there to help real people in need and I wasn't one.  I was faking my condition so I could get high.  I am now going to pay the price with a nasty withdrawal since I refuse to go to the ER's anymore and since my connect has cut me off.  It's time to pay the piper and i'm ready to do it, don't get me wrong.  But.......i'm just so scared.......scared of withdrawal, scared of that pink fog feeling afte withdrawal where I have no direction, no game plan, nothing to guide me.

I'm 30 years old and stil living with mommy and daddy and I have nothing to my name except piles of debt and insecurity issues.  I have almost no friends and ive spent the last few years just playing World of Warcraft and other games.  I try to immerse myself in videogames so I dont have to think about real life.

I thought I was on the right track for a brief time, only a math class away from getting an AA degree and you would think I could do it right, I mean my book was paid for, no bills, my parents pay for everything but I coulddn't even do taht much.

I am so good with computers but I cant even get a fking job at Walmart.

I can't even get a fking bank account cuz im chexsystem and no banks want me cuz of my history.

In societys eyes, i'm probably worthless and thats exactly how I feel.

I'm sorry, but this feels good even just typing this.  I am letting this out into the nether because im tired of bottling it inside and not telling anyone how I really feel.  

I've had to come out on my own, deal with it on my own, deal with my identity, deal with so much shit, I was bullied as a kid my entire middle and high school years for being fat.  In high school I was still in closet but people could tell, I was also a loner, had no friends just computers.

Even after the fact ive said all this, I have to say that I do truly appreciate and love life.  I just hate MINE.  I always fee like im in the wrong body, wrong family, wrong everything.  I feel like I just got a shitty hand dealt to me and ive handled it so wrong.  Made so many wrong choices.

I've treated so many people wrong and I used to blame them, im so good at blaming others but now I realize it really was me all along.  I feel so bad.

I want to be a good person that I know I am on the inside.  I am, well on some days.  But most of the time, im miserable and just a druggie.

Tomorrows my last day on pills then i start the pain and misery of what I already know is gonna be a HIDEOUS withdrawal.  The last 0392305 times I said it would be my last withdrawal but I always end up somehow getting them again.  This can be my last or my last until i get more but all I know is this time, im just gonna pay the piper.  No more excuses, no more pleading for it to stop, I brought this on my own and im gonna do it.

Life may not be perfect today but it's a hell of a lot better than chasing the needle and the pipe. 

I hope everyone's weekend is going great. You never have to use again even if you want to. Also, if anyone needs someone to talk to when shit gets bad, feel free to PM me. I'm happy to be of service any way that I can.

I've been using over a gram a day. Was just smoking up until two months ago. That was manageable at a gram lasting two maybe three days. Withdrawals then seem like a joke compared to now. But I can't see myself continuing to do this. But how am I going to get clean and still get a job in time to pay rent? Fuck. Here we go another junky who fucked up. Cliche. I am tempted just to delete this and not post it. Whatever. I'm over this lifestyle. I'm over spending money on dope instead of my kids and my responsibilities. Who am I? What the fuck am I doing....",1.0,Fucked up on day 7Was clean for 6 days,,,,

I posted in the check-in today that my new roommate told me last night that he has a (legitimate) prescription for oxy, which means my DOC is in my apartment. A really interesting discussion followed and I want to thank all of you for sharing your experiences and perspectives. 

A couple months ago I had a similar issue with my old roommate, where I found out he had an Adderall prescription because he left the receipt out on the counter. (Adderall wasn't my DOC but it's something I abused heavily.) I will admit that I lost my mind a bit, overreacted, and went into victim mode. The people on this subreddit really set me straight. They helped me see that triggers are going to happen and that I alone am responsible for my actions in response. 

So the Adderall incident and discussion on this subreddit really prepared me for the oxy incident. I felt so chill after finding out about the oxy that I wondered if I was under-reacting. Today it was on my mind a lot and I did experience a couple intense, mind-shuts-down-screams-at-me-to-use cravings. I appreciate those of you who are able to be around pills and not go crazy--I'm not quite there yet but hopefully I will be someday. But I also wasn't going crazy and I was able to think it through and respond in a rational way. 

One detail I didn't mention is that my roommate told me he gets sick from opiates and that he didn't plan to take them. This made things worse in my eyes because it meant that there would be pills in the apartment indefinitely if he wasn't going to take them. When I spoke to my sponsor about this she asked why he was holding onto the pills if he wasn't going to take them. That was a great question. See my roommate and I have an agreement that we will not consume, or bring into the apartment, alcohol and narcotics (with the exception of legally prescribed narcotics used as prescribed). So if he holds onto the oxy and takes it later, he's either taking it recreationally or taking it for pain but not as prescribed (because he was supposed to take it right after the surgery). And this essentially violates our agreement. So the solution my roommate and I agreed on is that he will either take any prescribed narcotics as prescribed, or he will get rid of them. So with the oxy, I now can rest easy knowing that he's either going to take them now and they'll be gone, or he will get rid of them. 

I'm proud of myself for how this was handled and I'm grateful to you guys for giving me your honest opinions because it really helped a lot. I'm also chuckling because I worked really hard to find a sober roommate, and of course this guy ends up having a prescription for my DOC. Oh, life.

I promised myself once I got to a certain milestone of sobriety I would come back and tell my story, in hopes that what I went through and learned will resonate with someone who is going through something similar. I planned on writing this earlier, around the 100-day mark, but it was still too much of an open wound. Nonetheless, here I am over 6 months sober ready to share with you guys. This will probably be a long read.

My addiction to opiates started in August 2015. I had always suffered from depression in my life, and as a result someone close to me offered me a 30 mg roxy because it was something he used to alleviate physical and emotional pain. I was never a hard drug user but I was so sick of feeling depressed that I took him up on the offer and boom. I was hooked. To make a long story short, I was addicted to roxies for about a year and a half. The first year I was using about 120-150 mg per day, with the last 6 months using 240-300 mg per day. Fortunately for me, I have a very lucrative job that always allowed me to afford roxies and never take the jump to heroin. I am very thankful for this, but at the time it did not make getting sober any easier. 

Around Jan 2017, my brother became aware of how bad my opiate problem was. Besides work my days only consisted of picking up, using, and nodding off. I was no longer interested in doing anything I formerly enjoyed. I quit partaking in my hobbies, let relationships die, and my overall health dramatically declined as I was barely eating and never exercising. 

By Feb 2017, I knew I had a serious problem and had to quit. I was spending over $300/day on pills and my tolerance was only getting higher. Plus I lost my GF due to my inability to get clean and lying about/hiding my using. I used to take solace in the fact that I was performing very well at my demanding and high-paying job, even while heavily using, to deny the fact that I was an addict. ""It's just how I want to spend my money,"" I would tell myself. ""Others like fancy watches or vacations, I just happen to love blues."" This opinion changed after a few unfortunate incidents that happened in my life that led me to wanting to take a break from pills. I thought if I took a few weeks or a month off I could lower my tolerance and save some money. The thing is, I was not able to take a break. The most I could salvage was a day or two of sobriety before I went back to blues. At this point I knew I had a serious addiction and had to quit.

When I first decided I wanted to quit opiates for good, I wanted to do it my way. I did not want to tell my parents (who I still lived with at the time), and did not want any professional help. I figured I could do it on my own. I was never more wrong in my life. You can check my post history to see how hard it was for me to get sober completely by myself. I couldn't get past 5 days without relapsing.

Finally, with the help of my brother, I decided to tell my parents about my problem because I was sick of relapsing. This was the best decision I ever made. They were slightly disappointed but 100 times more concerned with my health and doing anything to get me sober. With their help I was able to get therapy for my depression, and find a doctor who would administer vivitrol after one week of being clean. *One week.* **One whole week.** At the point I confessed to my parents, I was on my first day sober and unable to stay clean for longer than 5 days. I was in for one of the toughest challenges of my life.

Withdrawals for me were much less physical than they were mental. I literally wanted to commit suicide. I was so close to ending my life that it hurts for me to revisit this time because it was so painful. There were times I thought I wasn't going to make it, there were times I nearly relapsed. I cried, I was mean, and I hated myself for putting myself in this position. That week of sobriety was the hardest thing I put myself through, but in the end it was worth it. Once I got the vivitrol shot it felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I still had urges, I still wanted to get high, I still wanted to kill myself but it was much more manageable. 

As weeks turned into month, I became more and more like myself. I started hanging out with friends again. I started exercising and working out daily. I started laughing again, I started to feel again. Fast forward to now, I am in the best shape of my life! I see my friends regularly and I love being sober. Sure, I still think about opiates every now and then but any thought of wanted to use them is immediately followed by a thought of how bad my life was on them. I no longer have urges or cravings. I am so much happier now than I ever was on opiates. I still suffer from depression but therapy has helped and I am working on it. I still get my vivitrol shot once a month, but I'm at the point where I almost feel I don't need it anymore; that I can do it on my own because **I am in control,** not the pills. (Note: I have no plan of doing this, I will stay on the shot for probably another year just to be safe). If I can get sober, with my shitty attitude and lack of a will to live, I know you can. It will not be easy. In fact, it will most likely be the hardest thing you have ever done. But I can assure you one thing, it is worth it. I promise you that. You have to give it EVERYTHING you have. You have to fight with all of your willpower but it is worth it. I am so thankful for my support group and those who have helped me along the way because without them, I would not be here typing this today.

To end, here are a few things that were game changers for me. I know everyone is different but I would not be sober today if it weren't for these things:

1. Support - You cannot do this on your own. Look at me, I tried and failed miserably each time. When I kept my addiction to myself and tried to get sober alone, it was easy to relapse because *I was only hurting myself.* Once I told my family it was another thing completely. I was fine with letting myself down but even as a junkie addict, I was not okay with letting them down.

2. Strength - this sounds clichè, and I mentioned this already but you have to be strong in your fight for sobriety. You have to go into this knowing it is going to be one of, if not the, hardest things you have ever done. Opiates have control of you and will fight their hardest to keep control. It is up to you to fight back and not relapse. Many days are going to push you to the breaking point, while some days are easier than others. If you are willing to give it your all, I promise you will make it out on the other side.

3. Vivitrol - I know many people have differing opinions on the vivitrol shot but I can only speak from my experience and the experience of other former addicts I have spoken to. Vivitrol is an *absolute game changer*. It make sobriety so much more manageable by blocking your opiate receptors. It gives your brain and your spirit the boost it needs to kick the habit.

4. Keep away from triggers - this one sounds obvious but it is much harder and wide-ranging than you may think. I have had to say goodbye to more than one friend because of their ties to opiates. It was not easy but nothing worth achieving is. There are also some less obvious triggers that you need to avoid. For me, this subreddit and ones like it was a trigger. To me (and I mean no offense here) this sub seems to be accepting of relapsing i.e. it's part of the process, everyone does a couple times, etc. I got to a point where relapsing was not an option. I haven't been on this subreddit in months as a result. Whatever your triggers may be, and by triggers I mean things that in anyway can push you towards or even make you think about using, must be eliminated. It's not easy but you will be happy you did.

I used to think I was going to 'live and die' by opiates. I couldn't feel more differently today. It took me about 1-2 months (with vivitrol) to fully stop craving opiates. I am still on the road of recovery but life is good now. I can surely say I have made it out of the pit of addiction and reached sobriety. It was the toughest thing I have ever done, and pushed me to places I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but it was all for a greater, worthwhile purpose. I wish you all the best in your sobriety and hope my anecdotes will aspire you to keep fighting the good fight, because the future you will be happy you did.

He's looking for a job for the first time in 7 months I'm super proud of him for that!! He's going to have money coming in and he's not used to that. I'll give him an occasional $20 here and there for whatever, but besides that he never has his own money to handle. I take care of food, cigarettes, gas etc.

And pretty much the only meeting I go to anymore. It's an AA Last call and candle light meeting. It's usually chill and got lots of cool people. 
Well, last night we are all commencing the meeting beginning reads. We hear some strange moaning and ""oh god"" sounds from the women's bathroom right across the hall.  At first I though she was getting fucked in there, at no point did I think she just shot up and is getting fucked up. 
Well, it was the latter. 
Eventually the calls from her boyfriend became more urgent. She had locked the door. The moans became blanketed with pure silence. She was dying. 
Eventually the boyfriend kicks the door down and she's sprawled out on the bathroom floor with contraband. She's not really responsive, he's yelling for her to stay awake, and also asking what to do.
We call the police. They show up in about 3 minutes. It's a code 3. 
Ambulances, fire trucks, all show up with lights and sirens. 

Eventually the narcan turns her silent peace to agony and embarrassment. 
I hear her say as she is on the stretcher about to be placed into the ambulance, "" please, let me go. I'm fine, I just get really bad anxiety attacks."" (Like it wasn't obvious enough she was dying of an od)

Either way, I'm pretty sure she is going to be ok. Will she learn? Idk. But she was just recently released from detox like 2 days prior. So I wouldn't bet on it. 

I don't think I will be going to this meeting for a while if ever again. I'm not trying to isolate from potential triggers, but the one place I felt safe from that is the one place that let me down.  It only solidified my beliefs in AA/NA.

Also I've been on suboxone for a while and my sponsor kinda told me today that he doesn't know if I'll ever be able to stay clean while I'm on it. I kinda resent that because that's a fear I've had and am scared it may be true, but I'm scared I can't function without it. Any thoughts?

Some quick history: yesterday I was day 2 into a pretty serious poppy seed tea withdrawal. I average about 1kg (2.5 pounds) every other day, but lately probably closer to 2 days on the tea then one off. Anyway, the first day I'm fine due to the long half-life of the tea, so it's the second day when withdrawal kicks in.

Yesterday withdrawal hit like clockwork (around the 36 hour mark), so I took 170mg codeine and 6mg of loperamide at about the 48 hour mark. This gave me moderate relief, but I took it a bit early (7pm), so by the time 12am came around I'd fallen back into w/d. Restless legs is by far the worst symptom for me and I was kicking around until about 1am, when I had 50-60mg DXM, followed by another 150mg of codeine and another 20mg of lope. I know this was overkill, but I needed to sleep as I sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend and I don't want her knowing what's going on.

Anyway, I drifted off eventually and woke up HIGH at about 3:30am. Not only am I well out of withdrawal, but I'm fucking HIGH as a kite. Like, high as in I'd had a high dose of PST or 40mg oxy.

Usually I'd be all for it, but this was actually disappointing as I'm trying to do a rapid taper. Usually the ceiling effect of codeine (400mg) takes away wd, but doesn't get me high, so I don't think the codeine had much do do with it. It's now 6pm on day 3 and I barely feel any wd now, which is actually fucking annoying because I'd say that there is some synergy between the lope/DXM mix and I'm essentially dosed up on high levels of opiates when trying to quite. 20mg of lope barely takes away mild symptoms of wd for me usually and it has NEVER gotten me high. Codeine barely registers on my current tolerance, so it's definitely something to do with the DXM.

- Do I just call up there tell them an addict and how much I am doing (160- 240 mg a day) and they write the script? What are the normal dose they would start you on?

- There are 2 doctors in my town that prescribes subs (one is a little cheaper) but do they all work the same? Or do they all have different rules? I had a friend that went to the one the cost the most and the doc just wrote him a script once a month with every visit is this normal?

-  I don't have insurance and I have read that there are generic subs do I tell the doc I would like that brand or is that a bad idea, or do I just tell the pharmacy I want the generics?
 
- I am going to get the sub doc I live in now and will be living a few hours away from my doc in a couple weeks. Could this be a problem, like them calling for pill checks or random piss test?

SO, my question to all of you who have quit opiates before and specifically those of you whom have done so with bupemorphine, did youever experienc? such sever body pain that you were incapacitated for days at a time, what did you do to minimize the pain and debilitation, and how long did it last for?

I had tapered my suboxone down very quickly, down to 1mg from as high as 7mg when I was having my most intense withdrawls, in 1 week.  
Now with all the intense body pain Im in Im considering ramping back up the subs a little to try and relieve the muscle pain Im having but im worried about beig on the subs too long and getting sub locked.   Im also worried becuase im not surethat by taking more suboxone I am going to get relief from these pains and if I actually have something wrong I dont want to have to go the ER and not be able to get opiate pain theropy.

I have seen alomst a half dozen drs the last few days because im worried about what is causing all this pain and none of them seem to know whats goign on with me or what to do.  Tylenol helps but I can only take so much and im not really sure what else to do.

I've come to terms with my past, I no longer have that shame that comes with realizing that I am indeed an Addict, with a capital A. Using was my coping skill for life's shit. It was my go to, how ironic that using was causing my life to be shit. Putting my family and friends through hell just so I can keep on using. It was my everything. Been through rehab, relapse, jail, more rehabs, etc. Rinse and repeat, fuck rinsing, just repeat. That old saying, runs get shorter , consequences get greater and I didn't give a fuck. As long as I could feed the monster inside of me, as long as my addiction was satisfied, relationships didn't matter anymore. That was the old me.

Like a weight being taken off my chest.
I live in a recovery house. Over the past week I've seen 4 people relapse, get caught, kicked out, homeless or back in rehab, the vicious circle of bullshit continues. I know they are really trying to get this but the holidays are extremely hard, the emotional pain is killer for some and too overwhelming . they stopped going to meetings, started isolating , you know the signs, totally saw it coming for them. I tried to talk to them before the relapse but ultimately its their decision. I will not take any blame as I tried to help. If an addict is going to relapse, absolutely nothing can be said and no amount of consequences will stop them. All I can do is pray that they will get this and stop beating themselves up for going back out.
Let me switch gears. I've met a girl who is also in recovery. An ex-junkie just like me. She REALLY wants this, incredibly sincere about staying clean. Basicslly, she's in the same boat as me, lost her nursing job, legal problems, living in a recovery house etc. She's been through hell and doesn't want to be a junkie anymore. She wants her life back, to be a nurse again, to do the thing that she is passionate about, helping others. So, we've been dating for 2 months. Yeah, red flags. I know. We help each other stay clean. Support %100. Right from the start we have been totally honest about EVERYTHING. Our past, our dreams, everything. The basis of our relationship is based on honesty and trust. The support we give to each other is honestly what has kept me clean through these rough patches. Without her care and support I probably would have relapsed. And vice versa. Its truly special. I have no need to try and be somebody I'm not in fear of rejection. Helping her helps me. Together we have a chance of getting this right. Her parents have exiled her, refuse to even acknowledge that she is alive, let alone that she is clean and sober today. It breaks my heart that she cries about the falling out. I have no idea how to help her other than be there for her. I have provided the love and support that she needs and in return she has helped me immensely with my emotional state. I thank god for people like her in my life because if I relied on my housemates to stay clean, I'd be out there relapsing with them!

So I just cleaned up, it's been about 9 days now, and I'm through the worst of it.

I've had a lot of support this time and it feels good, I want to do things differently in order to avoid relapsing again.

My longest time clean was ~3 years, and I wasn't exactly ""clean."" 
I just replaced heroin with marijuana, which at the time seemed like the lesser of two evils. 

Yesterday I came across these three points on some recovery site I was visiting - 

How does cross addiction cause relapse:

1. All addictions work in the same part of the brain. Addiction is addiction is addiction. Therefore one drug can lead you back to any other drug. 

2. Even moderate drinking or smoking marijuana lowers your inhibitions, which makes it harder for you to make the right choices.
 
3. If you stop using your drug of choice but continue to use alcohol or marijuana, you're saying that you don't want to learn new coping skills and that you don't want to change your life. You're saying that you want to continue to rely on drugs or alcohol to escape, relax, and reward yourself. But if you don't learn those new skills, then you won't have changed, and your addiction will catch up with you all over again. 

Reading this last one really made me realize the mistake I made last time, and I want to shoot for complete sobriety this time around.

My problem is this, where do you draw the line where substance abuse is concerned?

I love coffee, I use it to reward myself and it gives me energy. If I don't limit myself I can drink it all day, coffee, redbull, 5 hour energy shots, caffeine is caffeine. 

Do I stop drinking coffee? 

I take Valerian root when I'm feeling anxious sometimes, it's not like getting high, but it's close, do I stop?

I realize these things seem trivial when compared with a heroin addiction, but I'm torn between allowing myself things that society doesn't really consider ""drugs,"" and relinquishing anything that might lead to abuse. 

Maybe I'm just scared to have nothing to use...

We had a pretty good visit with just a weird fight after he left me alone at his apartment for 2 hours and came back soaked from the rain. (No idea what he got up to when he was gone). But I figured since he was on methadone at pharma he had to have been  keeping clean to get the doses. (I am ignorant so please let me know if otherwise). He also told me he relapsed onto coke, not heroin, but that didn't make any sense to me as I thought methadone was only for heroin.

Well that's all back story anyway. Shit has been getting extreme in the last few days. Just to set this up for you:

- I'm on vacation/ sabatical with my fiancee out of country
- He's living with his wife (heroin addict) at her parents house in the same city where they have a bunch of drug friends
- He had a great job in a new city away from his SO... but got sick. Came back. Started living with her.
- For 3 weeks I didn't hear a word from him. No phone. No skype. No email. No FB. I had no idea what was going on, just heard scraps from ppl that he was sick, and leaving his good new job, moving back with SO, etc...

So. This week I get a call from the wife's father. He says my bro is depressed. Not doing well. Very sad and despondent as he generally has been for the last 10 years. I finally get to talk with him, my brother, and we had a pretty good chat. We talked about school, his plans for starting businesses and travel. 

Then today. Everything gets fucked up. I get a call out of the blue from the father in law (my brother's father in law). He says he has two crises on his hands: 1. the wife, his daughter, has been using heroin. She was out all last night at a drug dealers house. Finally at 6 in the morning, my brother found her and brought her back. He wants to send his daughter for treatment, and give her the ultimatum (she can't stay with him if she doesn't help her self)

2. The other problem is my brother. He is going mental. He is acting violent and saying mean things. (Not hurting anyone but kicking things around. He gets very very sensitive and it's impossible to reason with him). The father in law seems honestly concerned for my bro and just wants him to get help too. He suggested my bro take a bus to my mom's to chill out while the wife is in recovery.

This obviously is all blue sky thinking... the tricky part, as I tell him, will be getting the participants to volunteer to help themselves. I've read only a bit about these situations (mostly with your help, reddit), and I tell him I agreed with the plan.

Later today - I get another call. I can hear my brother screaming and yelling in the background. Saying nasty things to the father in law. It's awful and I know what it's like, I've been his surety before, had to take care of him, and nearly called the police on him a hundred times, because he can be so mean. But I know he's hurting. And I don't think he's bad at heart -- just fucking angry with the world. 

The other thing that has me really freaked out is that he has been struggling with unrelated health issues for about 7 years. Has had mutliple surgeries on his guts (colitis) to cope with it. These surgeries are obviously super scary for him and the family. And the drugs they prescribe him for the pain the in past I am sure have done their toll on his addictions. 

But he dropped a land min in our brief conversation today. After finally getting him on the phone, he' screaming about how the dad was just being greedy and forcing him and his wife to pay rent, and how they don't care about them and spewing all this rage. Which to me is completely nuts. Then he says he has cancer (related to his surgeries) and that he needs chemo and that ""he is probably not going to make it.""

So. Boom. Then he hung up. 

I have no idea if he actually has cancer. Or if he's saying anything to make people feel his pain. No idea. 

Thought I would share.

I need advice to hand off to the father in law, since he's the guy on the scene, and he's got the ball in his court. I don't want my brother hurting anyone. I want everyone to be safe. I want his wife to get better and not keep going back to H. (I want to hate her guts with all my heart.... but I also understand it's not her fault. And I don't wish her any pain. I do wish they would break up for ever though.)

Thanks for any help,
Me.

Sooo I made it 7 days before relapsing again.  This time, I had gotten a call from my neighbor asking me if I could cash his check for him.  He said that he was trying to get high and that he would pay for me--whatever I wanted.  (When does that shit ever happen, right?) At first, I told him no fucking way and that I was 7 days clean but it didn't take long for him to change my mind.  It seriously scared me how easy it was for me to give-in.  Just minutes before, I was absolutely determined to never get high again. That's crazy to even think about.

Anyways, I ended up copping 5 bags and did them all between friday night and early saturday morning.  I didn't shoot them this time around so hopefully I wont get real bad withdrawal rebound but I also didn't get sick which tells me that my tolerance is still a little high.  I took approximately 0.5mg of sub this morning so that I could be productive today but I don't plan on taking anymore.  The last thing I want is to get addicted to subs again.  I had a hell of a time getting off those nearly 3 years ago and I've since promised myself that I would never go back to them.  I decided back then that if I was going to get high, that I should feel both aspects of the dope (both the good side and the bad side) in order to logically assess what it is that I'm doing to myself each time I get high.  It did help and I never let my habit get out of control again but 3 years later I'm still constantly relapsing so obviously it wasn't a foolproof plan.  I apparently need to enhance my proactive strategies--maybe adopt a different strategy all together. While my original plan was a logical approach, addiction itself is an illogical behavior--this I hadn't considered at the time. Therefore, it's much more complicated than just avoiding withdrawal.  My brain doesn't give a fuck if I made it through 2 weeks of the worst withdrawal imaginable--if it wants to get high, it wants to get high and nothing will stop it from wanting that.

So, that brings me to my question.  I agree fully with the notion that while in early recovery, the addict should stay clear from people and things which could lead him/her back to using. (Not so much places though--that would be impossible unless I moved).  But the thing is, when there are drugs, dealers, and addicts everywhere, how is this even practical?  I mean sure I could change my phone number but that seems like more of a hassle than anything.  We live in an age now where anyone can be contacted via some form of social media. Years ago, there were only house phones and maybe a beeper.  Now you can contact people through phone, text, email, facebook, twitter, skype, etc.  If someone wanted to find me, they could. How can you possibly avoid this? I mean, even if I did ignore every single social outlet available to me, I would eventually run into people on the street anyway. I don't have a car so I walk/bus/subway everywhere and I know a lot of people in my neighborhood--some good and some bad obviously but my point is that, I'm unable to leave the environment that I'm in.  How would I handle this?  Fortunately, nobody I live with does drugs and nobody I work with or know from school does drugs so it's where I live that I'm most worried about.  Moving is not an option for me currently, although I do plan to move eventually when I can save up some money. My habit has prevented me from saving any money.

Another thing that is hard for me is letting people go.  I have a hard time being selfish and telling people I can't talk to them.  Most people that I've done this to in the past didn't take it well and that's still on my conscious today.  I guess it's worth it but it's not easy.  My nostalgia of the past just wont let go.  I've wasted 6 years on heroin addiction so all I can do is long for the days before it happened--the days when I had lots of friends and life was rewarding and interesting.

I'm trying to remember the day I made this account. I know I made it because there was so much incriminating stuff on my old account I decided to make a new one. Two years ago. Wow things sure can change in two years. 

Here I am. Turning 25 soon. Starting university. Got a girlfriend with a beautiful 3 year old daughter that I care for very much. Been working out a lot. Things are just going pretty well. I can't really quantify my exact clean time, because I do drink from time to time. But heroin doesn't have any place in my life at all anymore. And it hasn't for over a year. A lot of the PAWS stuff has gone away. No calls from connects. Friends call me for support, not to hook them up. Things are so very different. I've grown up a lot. 

I've been weening off sub for a while now, i'm down to almost 1mg. Soon. I wanted to be off by the end of June but I realized it's going to take a little longer. That's ok. I just can't stand the restless leg I get when I drop too much! Fucking uncomfortable. But it's like everything else in life, patience is the key.

I've been realizing that watching this little 3 year old munchkin. Kids don't understand patience. The idea of waiting for something basically means it will never happen to a kid. They want it NOW. And that's pretty much how I was for much of my young adult life. I could never fathom the idea of doing something today to improve my life tomorrow. Or doing something today that won't improve my life tomorrow, or the next day, but done consistently over time will. That's just life now.

It's like when people go on diets. It's not a diet you need, this is just how you need to eat now. Everyday. This is life now. So learn to love it or fight to change it, because this is what it is. Stay patient my friends. We can all turn this thing around into something wonderful. No doubt.

Maybe only if you *desperately* need pain support and can't get it for whatever reason - it does work.

I'm dealing with cravings at the very moment. They aren't intense, but just enough to keep them coming into my mind every now and then. I go to a meeting but haven't brought this up yet (I'm an alcoholic), I'm hoping exercise will help get those endorphins going normal.

They didn't offer me one, they know what I went through on regards to pills because I met them just after I quit using. But, just seeing that fuckin bottle and all those wonderful little white pills. My old friends that made this life so much more tolerable. Low dose (.25mg) or not, I fuckin *wanted* those pills. I wanted to stuff my face with them until I got that familiar drunk feeling when you've taken too much. My mind even tricked me by going into full on panic mode, trying so desperately to make me ask for one, offer to buy some, anything to get my hands on them.

The feeling progressed into a panic attack. I even had to leave and go home because I could not get those fuckin pills off my mind. Once I was home, I spent the next several hours crying and hyperventilating, going through every little trick I use to use to calm myself down. But I couldn't get the question out of my head ""all this time now since you've been clean, and you're still here at your parents, still not in school, and bouncing from shit job to shit job so you can keep making your car payments. What the fuck are you even doing?"" Which soon devolved into a nonstop monologue of ""what am I doing? Where am I going? What am I even trying to accomplish?"" All the feelings of guilt came flooding back, the self hate, the crushingly low self esteem.

I finally feel asleep. I had an interview at 9 this morning, but when I woke up I just felt so broken. I turned my phone down and just went back to sleep. I've slept for over 12 hours now, waking up every few hours to cry and hate myself again. I completely blew off the interview, my mom is pissed at me because this job may have finally got me out of her house, and I have to go back to working in a kitchen that I hate because I was too ashamed of myself to face the day today.

I don't understand guys. All this time, and I'm still this fuckin weak. I've been under so much stress trying to make ends meet and making payments, and the craving for that xanax just pushed everything over the edge.

However every time I manage to make it a few days, I just jump right back into using. This is going to be a big wall of text but I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. 

This time I'm ready. I'm serious about quitting. 

Just a little background (possible triggers please be aware) I've been using anywhere from 5-8 Oxycontin 80mg pills a day by snorting them. I buy anywhere from 30-50 at a time for thousands of dollars. It's been this bad since about last April and before that I was doing 10 8mg Diluaids a day. I work as a TA at a university making about $1700 a month and I blow it all on drugs. I should have about 13k saved up from when I started and it's basically all gone up my nose.

On Monday I called a friend of mine who has been clean for over 2 years now and is hardcore into the NA scene. I admitted that I need help to him. I've lost a lot of friends, my self control, and my self respect but I haven't come close to losing ""everything"" as they say. I'm getting a Masters degree in Economics and doing very well and in the process of applying for jobs.

Anyways, I went to my first meeting on Tuesday. Besides the guy I went with I ended up knowing a couple of other guys there. It was great - everyone was super supportive, giving me hugs and telling me that they are here for me. I got a pamphlet with a bunch of phone numbers and was truly amazed at the love I received just by walking in. 

I'm ready to quit for real this time. I see all the people posting here talking about how supportive and helpful everyone in this sub is and I want to be a part of it. I've been lurking for a long time now. 

I've managed to get myself down to 2 pills a day. I was recommended that before I quit I should try and ween down just a little bit to make my withdrawals a little bit easier. I'm not going to use Suboxone or Methadone as I don't believe that is the right choice for me. Not that I judge anyone who does it by any means whatsoever, whatever works for you I support as long as it keeps you clean. But I don't think it's for me. 

I know I'm not clean yet I am very aware. But this time I'm for real. What happens to me besides the standard W/D symptoms, is that I wake up super early (I never have problem sleeping but I only sleep for like 5 hours) and I am STARVING. Absolutely starving so much that I have to get out of bed and eat. And even when I do eat I still can't get back to bed and I'm still hungry. And I am hungry allllll day which is strange because even when I use I eat 3 meals a day with snacks.

So the last few days, I've been doing one in the morning before I go to school and then I don't do another one for 9-12 hours. Again, I am aware that I shouldn't be using at all but I figure this time I have some self control and if I can just ween a little bit it will be easier to get through the withdrawals. I know it's inevitable that I'll feel like shit for a week but I got a few boxes of Loperamide, can steal a few of my moms valiums or Lyrica if I so choose, and have access to pot (as in I will just steal it from my little pothead brother haha). Even though I don't smoke weed anymore, the times that I have tried to quit I'll smoke half a joint and I can see the amazing merit to it. 

I'm going to another meeting on Saturday with the guy I went to the one on Tuesday with. He's been amazingly supportive and I speak to him on the phone everyday for at least an hour. It's great!

I'm really serious about this. I have so many things in front of me to lose and I can't let that happen. I want to get an amazing job without having to be high all the time (in April I'll have a fucking Masters degree!!!! It baffles me at how awesome that is, not to sound arrogant). I want to go to the gym. I've always been skinny and pale my whole life, but right now I'm 5'11 and weigh 125 pounds. It's gross. I want to start doing Yoga, and pick up my guitar again to make music.

My school has been going amazing, I just got back an assignment yesterday that took me 6 weeks to complete, the biggest assignment I've done in my life. And I got perfect! But everything else in my life revolves around Oxys. I can't function without them and I am so done with that lifestyle. 

Ok well I guess if you've made it this far you get my story. And I truly express my gratitude to you for taking the time to read this. You guys have no reason to believe me about wanting to get clean because I've posted here probably 3 or 4 times before. But I'm genuine in my intent this time and I think that by going to meetings and finding a sponsor shows a little bit of how serious I am. I know that doing 2 a day is by no means acceptable but I need to start somewhere. To go from doing 7 a day to less than half of that is a big step for me despite what anyone else thinks. I have 1 pill left for tomorrow and then the real hell begins. But I'm doing this. I need my life back. I don't know Beta-one anymore. I don't know the person I see in the mirror. Beta-one is gone and he needs to come back. 

I'm so good at hiding it - my parents (whom I live with) have absolutely no fucking idea what's going on. They think that everything in my life is perfect. Far from it. And I refuse to come clean to them because it will crush them. I know I can do this without going to them for help. I did coke from the ages of 16-21 before I ever touched opiates and I quit that cold turkey. I smoked pot for almost a decade and have managed to quit that also. I'll only smoke once in a blue moon and because it helps with the withdrawals I don't mind smoking a quarter of a joint if it helps. I know for fact I'm not going to become addicted to that again because I have no interest.

Fuck I was supposed to stop typing 2 paragraphs ago. Sorry. Thanks again for reading and to all of you who are clean or are just starting like me we can fucking do this! We are all beautiful people and will figure it out. There have been so many deaths in /r/opiates as of late and it literally kills me to see that and I don't want it to happen to me. I love you all so much you are so inspiration. Love love love love.

TL;DR I'm ready to quit this time. Started going to NA, have cut my usage to a quarter of what it was and will be cold turkey by Saturday. Love.

However every time I manage to make it a few days, I just jump right back into using. This is going to be a big wall of text but I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. 

This time I'm ready. I'm serious about quitting. 

Just a little background (possible triggers please be aware) I've been using anywhere from 5-8 Oxycontin 80mg pills a day by snorting them. I buy anywhere from 30-50 at a time for thousands of dollars. It's been this bad since about last April and before that I was doing 10 8mg Diluaids a day. I work as a TA at a university making about $1700 a month and I blow it all on drugs. I should have about 13k saved up from when I started and it's basically all gone up my nose.

On Monday I called a friend of mine who has been clean for over 2 years now and is hardcore into the NA scene. I admitted that I need help to him. I've lost a lot of friends, my self control, and my self respect but I haven't come close to losing ""everything"" as they say. I'm getting a Masters degree in Economics and doing very well and in the process of applying for jobs.

Anyways, I went to my first meeting on Tuesday. Besides the guy I went with I ended up knowing a couple of other guys there. It was great - everyone was super supportive, giving me hugs and telling me that they are here for me. I got a pamphlet with a bunch of phone numbers and was truly amazed at the love I received just by walking in. 

I'm ready to quit for real this time. I see all the people posting here talking about how supportive and helpful everyone in this sub is and I want to be a part of it. I've been lurking for a long time now. 

I've managed to get myself down to 2 pills a day. I was recommended that before I quit I should try and ween down just a little bit to make my withdrawals a little bit easier. I'm not going to use Suboxone or Methadone as I don't believe that is the right choice for me. Not that I judge anyone who does it by any means whatsoever, whatever works for you I support as long as it keeps you clean. But I don't think it's for me. 

I know I'm not clean yet I am very aware. But this time I'm for real. What happens to me besides the standard W/D symptoms, is that I wake up super early (I never have problem sleeping but I only sleep for like 5 hours) and I am STARVING. Absolutely starving so much that I have to get out of bed and eat. And even when I do eat I still can't get back to bed and I'm still hungry. And I am hungry allllll day which is strange because even when I use I eat 3 meals a day with snacks.

So the last few days, I've been doing one in the morning before I go to school and then I don't do another one for 9-12 hours. Again, I am aware that I shouldn't be using at all but I figure this time I have some self control and if I can just ween a little bit it will be easier to get through the withdrawals. I know it's inevitable that I'll feel like shit for a week but I got a few boxes of Loperamide, can steal a few of my moms valiums or Lyrica if I so choose, and have access to pot (as in I will just steal it from my little pothead brother haha). Even though I don't smoke weed anymore, the times that I have tried to quit I'll smoke half a joint and I can see the amazing merit to it. 

I'm going to another meeting on Saturday with the guy I went to the one on Tuesday with. He's been amazingly supportive and I speak to him on the phone everyday for at least an hour. It's great!

I'm really serious about this. I have so many things in front of me to lose and I can't let that happen. I want to get an amazing job without having to be high all the time (in April I'll have a fucking Masters degree!!!! It baffles me at how awesome that is, not to sound arrogant). I want to go to the gym. I've always been skinny and pale my whole life, but right now I'm 5'11 and weigh 125 pounds. It's gross. I want to start doing Yoga, and pick up my guitar again to make music.

You guys are the only people who would really, truly understand the clusterfuck my life has been recently. 

So, fuck, let's start at the beginning. 

It all started with GOOD NEWS. 

I got a new job recently. It's a good job, one that I was determined to keep. Yet somehow I fucked myself over, again. 

I was doing orientation the past week and I was late 2 days in a row. Not TOO late, but late enough for it to be a problem. Obviously you never want to be late for anything regarding work or school but shit happens... in my case, I had some sort of Murphy's Law thing going on but mostly it was just me not being as diligent as I should have been. 

I was using Percocet from the 18th of July until I ran out yesterday (120 x 5/325, didn't CWE any of them) ... Let's not get into that because I know what I'm doing to my liver and it's not fucking good. I know. Nothing I am doing is good really. 

By the time my new job orientation started, I was trying to taper down my dosage so I wouldn't be high and I wouldn't be sick at work, but I kept fucking myself over and over and over... Oh, I'll take an extra one today... an extra 2 here... an extra 3 here... what was supposed to last 10 days lasted 5 days. 

Now I am on scraps of Suboxone which is keeping me fairly decent but obviously that is going to run out too. 

Also, I had an impacted stool recently. It was the most painful, humiliating thing in my life. I had to fucking reach into my asshole and remove the stool, piece by fucking piece. I wouldn't wish that shit [ha, ha] on fucking HITLER... but it happened to me. Don't let it happen to you. Fiber, magnesium, vegetables, WATER... everything... let yourself get sick so you can shit... Having an impacted stool is awful. I wanted to die right on the toilet. 

So basically the next few days are going to be when I figure out if I get fired or not. And I'll probably be pretty dope sick. It's gonna fucking suck either way you spin it. 

I'm writing this because I just... don't know what to do... I know I need to quit drugs, but I still can't find it within me. Should I get on Suboxone maintenance? Then that costs money! Which I don't have. 

Should I get on Methadone? That, I feel, is going to fuck me over even worse because I have had periods where I've gone cold turkey and my habit wasn't that bad. 

I've been punching myself in the head and punching my desk over and over and I've got the worst headache because I don't want to self-harm even though that's technically self-harming... I just need some sort of guidance... I thought things in my life were going better but it's back to that deep, depressing black hole once again...

So from the initial call I was feeling really good about this place. I have been to numerous facilities and they just really said all the right things. Once I arrived the staff was excellent. I was not sober and they were very patient with me doing paper work. They got me all settled In at about 5pm and i went to bed. The next day i woke up and found they had put all my clothes away in drawers for me and kept my suitcases. No big deal but for some reason this irked me A bit that they kept my suitcases. A resident said after a few weeks you get them back.   So I went in there with a few infections/cellulitis I wasn't concerned about because I knew the dr would get me on antibiotics. In fact I left out that they gave me a shot of antibiotic the first day before they put me to bed. So they seemed to be on top of there game. So anyways day 2 comes and they still haven't ordered my suboxone and whatever they give for benzo taper which I was told  was Librium. The dr orders me another shot of antibiotic but for some reason forgot to enter it in forgot my subs and Librium and had left for the day by the time I finally asked when i was getting it. I don't like to be a needy patient but in hindsight I should've been more proactive and asking about this. I went to go smoke a cigarette and that's when I realized they keep all of your cigarettes behind the desk and you have to ask for them one by one and they Keep all of your lighters and only staff can light your cigarette.  Again not a huge deal just annoying.  Especially since most of you that have been treatment know there's a whole lot of cigarette smoking going on as there  is often not much else to do and it's a stressful situation. I usually smoke twice as much in treatment as I do in the real world So day two went by without really anything notable happening except for eating some food which was surprisingly some of the better food that I've had at a facility. I noticed the patients seem to be much older than any facility I'd ever been to the average age seem to be around 35. I'm used to the average age being 22 or 23 the age thing does not bother me though as I'm almost 30 and can get along with any age group. My two roommates were both 50+ but they were cool and it wasn't a problem. I noticed that the patients there really seem to care about getting clean and it did not seem to be a bunch of scheming of who could get what and who snuck what in but how they could work together to stay clean and it seems like a positive community. It was really refreshing to see that atmosphere in a rehab facility I had never seen before. Then day three comes and a counselor comes and gets me and tells me that my mom has been calling and asking me to fill out a form so that she could contact me. I go to her office and I'm making small talk and tell her that I was joking around with male staff trying to see if I could get one of them to check my fantasy football league for me. I was completely joking and lighthearted and smiling and it was nothing serious at all. However  she freaked out and said that that's the manipulative bullshit that I'm there  to quit and learn to live without manipulating people. I calmly replied to her that I was there to quit drugs not fantasy football and that I was just joking around with them and in no means manipulating them by asking them to tell me how my fantasy team was doing. I then asked her if she was the only counselor there or is there other counselors and if there is other counselors if I could put in for another counselor because I believe that I would work better with another counselor. She again snapped at me and said that she would make sure that she was my counselor so she could ensure that I would quit my manipulative bullshit so I got up and walked out of the room without saying anything she screamed at me you won't be able to talk to your mother now. Did not phase me as I knew that I could eventually get another counselor who would help me with my stuff. About this time I realized that my infections were really really bothering me to the point that I was almost in tears and then I remembered that they never gave me my shot the day before.  I told the staff that I kind of had an emergency and needed to be moved to the top of the list to see the doctor. They told me that there was a list to see the doctor and that I may be on it and I may not be and that if I was that they would call me whenever it got to my turn.  I insisted that I needed to be moved to the top as I had really really bad infections and on day three but closer to 48 hours  had still not been given any Suboxone or anything for my Xanax dependency. Two or three staff members jump down my throat telling me that I could not get moved to the top of the list and that's not how things work and that I needed to understand that I'm not the only patient there and I could see the doctor tomorrow if not today.  luckily for me  one staff member kind of pulled me aside and said I know that you have some bad infections I'll make sure you get put at the top of the list. A few minutes later the doctor came in and sure enough they brought me right to her so I was really thankful that the staff or that one particular staff member took me seriously. The doctor looked at my infections for maybe a second or two and ran out of the room screaming call an ambulance he needs to be at the hospital immediately. So I walk out of the room and look at the techs that were so mean to me and that had previously told me that I may or may not be able to see the doctor that day like see I told you so like I wasn't just making this up. They told me to pack for a week because I would probably be admitted in the hospital for a week. I told them sure I'll pack but if I'm going to the hospital for a week that I would like my cell phone to take with me for obvious reasons. They refused and said that I under no circumstances could have my cell phone. I asked them who's care I would be  under and who's liability I would be under while I was in the hospital theirs  or the hospitals and they told me I would be in the hospitals care. I told them that there was no way I was going to the hospital for a week without my cell phone. They told me the only way I was getting my phone is if I  left their place against medical advice.  Meanwhile the doctor still freaking out telling them do you not understand how critical it is that he gets to the hospital why are you arguing with him and the doctor and a tech agreed that they should give me my phone in emergency situation like this and that I give it back to them when I left the hospital and come back to the facility. 20 minutes later taking up the chain of command they determine that I cannot have my cell phone and I tell them that I am then going to leave AMA and I will take myself to the hospital. The doctor still telling them how important it is that I get to the hospital right away is insisting that they hurry up the process if I'm choosing to leave AMA. As any facility does when you try to AMA they sent the whole Calvary one by one to try to talk to me into not leaving the program. everybody from the techs all the way up to therapist medical and  CEO I believe the secretary even came and spoke to me. They held me up for about two hours trying to convince me not to AMA while the doctor kept telling them that I needed to get to the hospital. Finally they get the paperwork done for me to AMA and they give me my stuff and my suitcases and allow me to pack I'm at the front desk at this point and my phone's dead and I ask if I can charge it to call to get a Uber to go to the hospital or get a ambulance or a cab or provide myself some means of transportation to the hospital. I lived 4 states away so couldn't call family.  I'm told that I am not allowed to charge my phone. Keep in mind that the infections on my feet are so bad I can barely walk and the nearest place that I could've gone was the shopping center about a mile away which normally would've been no problem but would have been about 500 miles in my current condition. Luckily for me one of the the head people in the corporate office realized how dire my situation was and volunteered to give me a ride to the shopping center. I think this honestly made a bunch of other staff members mad that he was willing to help me. So there he drop me off at a shopping center hours after I was supposed to be taken to the hospital. I finally charged my phone and called my family to let them know what was happening in my family decided it would be best for me to catch an immediate flight home and go to the hospital at home  where my family could be with me so there was a flight leaving right away and I was able to hop on it. At no point did the facility ever contact my emergency contact which is my father who I had a release for they did not tell him anything they did not tell him that I needed to go to the hospital that there is any type of situation and they did not call and tell him that I left. so when I called him it was the first time of him finding out anything. So here I am in more pain than I've ever been in my life about wanting to cry the whole way from what just happened and feeling like I let my family down by leaving the facility which they were really really hoping would finally change my life. I was scared that my family would disown me but thank God they heard me out and listened to what happened before they just blocked me and disconnected my phone which is what would've happened and I was told would happen if I left early under any circumstance . So I feared when my dad saw my phone number calling that he would disconnect it. The facility itself was pretty decent although it was a old shopping strip mall that they had converted into a rehab facility. The place definitely had some features that I did like including the food and the positive atmosphere of the patients and willingness or not willingness so much as desire to stay or get and stay clean. The staff however seemed to lack any common sense or compassion and a concerning lack of training. They were so concerned about losing their $30,000 for the month that they held me up for hours when I needed to be at the hospital.  And yes although I decided to fly home first before the hospital I could've flown home hours earlier and been taken care of hours earlier if they didn't hold me up. I just can't get out of my head the flight home with the most agonizing infections in both feet amd both hands it was so god awful. My family was furious that there was no contact in the hours that this was going on to let them know that there is even an emergency my family agreed that if I was going to be at the hospital for a week that I should've had my phone and luckily supported me in my decision of leaving. There are so many great facilities in the US  at this time that I just cannot recommend this facility for any reason to anybody even though It did have a couple good features, the features that were good were not as important as the features that are bad. If you know anyone that is trying to get help and seeking a place for recovery advise them to stay clear of this place. 


Tldr-  needed immediate medical care. Held up for hours by staff trying to talk me into not leaving the program even though the dr was yelling I needed to get to the hospital.  They missed giving me a shot of antibiotic and passed the 48 hour mark had still not been giving suboxone or Librium.  They never once got in contact with my emergency contact to let them know of anything going on.  Avoid recommending this place to anyone you know.
