It went on for about 6 months, came to a head when he decided it didn't matter that I was telling him no and that I was't ready to have sex for the first time. I stayed with him about another month after that. Two years later, another girl pressed charges. I ended up testifying against him. He got out of jail about a month ago and has been making my life a living hell since then. My anxiety has SKYROCKETED since he's been out.

Im gonna try and let you guys know the extent of my habit so you can get a feel where I'm coming from and to perhaps fill me in on the withdrawal's im going to go through.

From May 2013-August 2013 I was doing perhaps 4-10 oxy 30's a week. 75% IV / 25% snorting. Then around mid September I started doing H (IV) as well. 

So I started to do 3-7 points of H a week; which was coupled with 2-4 oxy 30's a week as well. I kept that habit up until January 9th, 2014. I got busted then on 2 Felony drug distribution charges. However I made bail the next day and was out. But I got on subs then and started taking a qtr of an 8mg sub every morning...sometime missing a day here in there.

Around Feb 10 i cut my sub use in half. I was able to make a whole sub last me a week. Then i relapsed. I would do H or oxy one to three nights then get back on the sub regimen. 

I was maintaining like that until last week. ( March 6th ) When i had a full 48 hrs off sub and I didn't even feel physically sick.

I relapsed 2 nights ( 1 night H, another oxy ) then back onto the lower dose of sub. Which leads up to where I am now.

Sorry about the novel, but I really would appreciate any advice and help getting through this detox once and for all. What should I expect? How long will it last?

My Personal Experience","So here it is, the suboxone ""review"" per se that I have been meaning to post on here for about two months now. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom for you guys's convenience then. 

Stage set- Backstory 
It's October of 2013 and I have just relapsed after a year of clean time (entirely substance free). I start reverting back to all of my old addict ways. Fast forward 3 months and I'm already sick and tired of it all over again. My relationships (Especially that with my girlfriend at the time) are all strained at all ends. 

I want out, I want out so badly, but I don't have the ""Luxury"" of being thrown into jail unexpectedly like last time, no way to get that clean time under my belt again, so I decide it's time to check into a clinic. 
Suboxone was my choice for a couple reasons. 
1- I enjoyed Methadone, and I knew that I would abuse it given the chance.
2-The opiate blocker was definitely something I wanted, knowing that (again at least with methadone) I would push the envelope. 
and 3- A clinic was close, and I was easily accepted into it.

I somehow made it about 5 or 6 days with no use, after confessing to my family that I had relapsed, I had their full support. 
I went to the appointment, and they advised that I start out on a WHOLE 2 strips. This was insanity to me (I was only on a 60 to 90mg a day oxy habit, snorted) and I explained that I would like to start on a VERY low dosage, 2 mg is what I told them. 
I took my first dosage as I got home and shortly after, relief flowed through my body. I caught a slight buzz, which wasn't all that appealing, but the fact that I no longer craved, and every other symptom of having been an addict instantly disappeared seemed AMAZING to me! It felt like an absolute God-send! 

About a week later I asked to be upped to 4mg a day, and a couple months after that, I asked for 8mg a day. I found that cravings had made their way through, and I felt that I needed to put a stop to this and that this was the proper way at the time. I felt invincible. I felt no need for any other form of help. As long as I took the miracle drug I didn't need to do anything else. 

Looking back now, and even during the process of getting out of it, I see so many things wrong with so much. A lot of it came to light to me, when my girlfriend of almost 2 years ended it for good. 

See, although Suboxone had most definitely stopped the cravings, and the shitty feelings of PAWS (Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms) I never began to heal. It became more and more apparent to me, that I was still the exact same person that I was while using pills, except I didn't need to Lie, Cheat, or Steal. I was still a short fuse, I was still irrational at times for no reason, I was still the same asshole that I came to detest, and that I wanted to change from. 
That isn't solely based on my relationship with my ex either, ALL of my relationships suffered over time. 

Now the second awful, awful thing that I found about suboxone while trying to get off was this. The Detox. The dreaded suboxone withdrawals. 
As I was getting off, I tapered over the course of ""About"" 3 months. A little bit sooner. 
I had initially been trying to take a mg off every two weeks or so, but that proved very painful for me around the 3mg mark, and was taking far too long for my taste. 
I wont bore you with how I tapered, but needless to say, it was hell. 
In my personal opinion, the withdrawals from Suboxone were worse than anything I had ever experienced in my pill usage. 
Even stopping taking it, weaned all the way down to .25mg was hell. 
The ONLY thing that was easier about it than pill withdrawal was the fact that I didn't crave it. It was never something I enjoyed.

So I weaned off completely, and when I did, I quickly relapsed..
I started taking pills again to combat the withdrawals (Or so I told myself) from the subs.
As of tomorrow, I am checking into an inpatient rehab facility to start being clean again the right way.

Input requested at the bottom! Thanks!

I quit today. I've relapsed a total of 3 times and this will be the third time I quit.

I've realized that this might not be the last time. But you know what? **It's ok. It's going to be fine. So what, it's just a passing event**

I have stocked up on:

* Clonidine (this stuff is the best)
* Promethazine (for nausea)
* Immodium (for poopy time)
* Valium (for all the time)
* Advil (aches and pains... oh they will be fun)

Tomorrow I have to go to work and it will suck but hopefully I've timed it so that the worst will be over by Monday. 

I read online that Suboxone is DEFINITELY a two week (or more) withdrawal period while plain ol' oxy is about 3-6 days. 

I've experienced both - and I have to say fuck buprenoprhine, it's just awful.

* First addiction: 30mg oxy / a day for 30 days
* Second Addiction 1 year mixed oxy 30mg / bupe 8mg
* Third Addiction (current): 3 months , up to 180mg oxy / day

**Before I start do any of you think I should taper? or since I have to go to work 9-5, should I go a few more days on oxy and quit on a wednesday or a thursday? (so I can be somewhat presentable at work)**

* Third Addiction (current): 3 months , up to 180mg oxy / day

**Before I start do any of you think I should taper? or since I have to go to work 9-5, should I go a few more days on oxy and quit on a wednesday or a thursday? (so I can be somewhat presentable at work)**

Thanks,

I am on day 5 of a month long H relapse. Sitting on the toilet at work and finally took my first semi-solid shit...thank god

I found this subreddit on Monday. It has SERIOUSLY helped me this week. Thank you everyone for your stories.

I have not heard a story quite like mine yet, so I thought I would share and get your opinions/feedback.

Long story short: started drinking at 13, smoking weed at 14, other drugs mixed in the years, opiates for the first time at 18 (roxy), H for the first time at 21.

I was doing roxys for a good 3 years straight while in college. My brother introduced me, then he somehow was able to completely quit.

I left that school and moved home and transferred to a school close by to get away from the pills, then of course hit up an old dealer who I thought would have them and he had H. I never should have met him.

So I was doing H every day, snorting, failing classes while trying to become an Engineer. My parents never knew, and supported me through school.

One day my dealer was out for a couple days. I was withdrawing and fell asleep at the wheel while skipping class and wrecked my car. I came clean to my parents on the way home. Luckily nobody was injured, but it scared the hell out of me. 

I quit completely cold turkey. No subs, no benzos or weed. It wasn't so bad because I felt so ashamed the guilt outweighed the withdrawal.

So I got clean, and graduated! Called my old dealer literally on the way home from walking on graduation, my cap and gown and diploma in the back seat.

I got offered a sweet job as an engineer a month later. Of course I was smoking weed, H, Xanax, everything. I tried to trick the pre employment drug test with fake pee. The fake pee was too hot and I failed. I quit again. Cold turkey again. This time the withdrawals were so much harder, but I got clean.

2 months later I got offered another job, actually a way way way better job than I was about to take the first time. I started and I am doing great. Started dating an AMAZING girl from college. Sweet girl who does not do any drugs/drink at all. I told her about my past before I asked her to date me.

Last month I relapsed again. My tolerance got right back up within a couple days. I was using for a month until Sunday when I decided fuck this. I'm not going to wait until I fuck something up before I quit this time.

Nobody knows about this relapse. I quit cold turkey again on Sunday. Fucking terrible. I had to take a day off of work, but I'm back at it, and was recently told I will be getting a raise.

Has anybody else been able to quit like this with no physical support from anybody, and no other drugs? Thank god I have you guys to vent to about this. It's hard as hell to do on your own.

Only my immediate family and gf knows I ever took pills in the first place. None of my friends do it or know that I had an addiction. I don't want to go to any meetings because I really don't identify with addicts I guess, and I don't want anybody to know I still struggle.

I really hope this was the last time I ever relapse. It was the first time I ever truly quit on my own. I would recommend it too.

It's still hard, but maybe I'm just being a little bitch about it all and making excuses for myself?

I'm back at square one AKA Pure hell and I just keep burning and burning that foil, knowing damn well it's the cause of all of this.

I managed to get 2 days clean before I went out and used again, that's the longest I've stayed clean in months and that happened a few days ago. Honestly, what I'm trying to accomplish out of this post is that I need people to talk to. My girl is at work all day Monday thru Friday and I'm bored so I go hustle, make some money, get high, and I'm usually back by the time she gets home at 7:30 pm and if I'm not home, I'm ignoring her phone calls and texts making her stress and won't answer or come home til I score.

I'm not myself anymore, it's been almost a year since I relapsed on Christmas Eve and I can't believe I threw everything away and I've fallen so far....People used to be proud of me, my dad used to brag about how good of a son I was, and now no one in my family wants anything to do with me and the close relationships I had with people have diminished. Only 3 people in my life still care and that's my wonderful girlfriend/baby momma, my cousin who is also going to be the god father of my child, and my mom who keeps telling me to hang on until January and I'll be on her insurance so I can go to a detox and then rehab. But January seems like centuries away and I know I'm just going to keep using until then. I've been in IOP, the same one that got me clean the first time, for almost 3 months now and I've made only an ounce of progress, it's safe to say that IOP isn't enough this time around.

So I need some legal advice as well as rehab advice and people to talk to who are just like me. So if you are reading this and you want to talk, shoot me a PM and I'll give you my number then text  me because I'm always free and if I don't text you back right away then that might mean I'm up to no good and you should call me or something.

Any advice is appreciated. ",is appreciated. I had been clean for a year until i relapsed about a month ago. ,2012-08-29 18:26:51,"{'timex-value': '2012-07-29T06:51', 'start': 61, 'end': 78, 'text': 'about a month ago', 'type': 'TIME', 'value': '2012-07-29T06:51'}",2012-07-29T06:51,31.0

I've tried and tried and tried. Relapse, withdraw, mind games, relapse. This has been going on for over a year.

I always thought I could do it alone. I relapsed again this weekend.

I have been to two meetings now, one out of the city I live in with people with lots of clean time. And one last night slap bang in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the UK. It was very different, two women were nodding the fuck out and one bloke was obviously going through WD.

However different these two meetings, they were both the same. I felt the same energy in that room, listening to speakers and taking little nuggets of information from everyone. I even spoke for the first time, the room was quiet and I literally said ""Fuck it, I'm HThrowAway and I'm an addict"" then went on a stream of consciousness, anger, resentment towards myself, how I've got to stop listening to the voice in my head. Its a blur but everyone clapped after! A few guys said that takes some balls at your 2nd meeting.

I left both with the same buzz, I'm not alone, there are people in those rooms from armed robbers to doctors. Addiction truly does not discriminate. I feel I can do it this time, I've already got some numbers of people with 10+ years clean time. And the one thing everyone said was ""keep coming back"" and I will, at least one a week.

Also I listened to you guys about the dark depressing days I was getting, with suicidal intrusive thoughts. I'm on an SSRI and the waiting list for CBT.

From 2000 to 2005 I was addicted to heroin. In april of that year I quit.
Succesfully, until I relapsed in september of 2013. At first I used just in the weekends, but gradually I started using more. It's now become a daily thing.
Anyway, I want to stop using this coming friday. I'm very afraid, because I know what's coming. Sickness, sleepless nights etc. But I've done it before and I know I can do it again.
This was just a quick intro, I'll be writing more on friday, when the withdrawals will begin.

Succesfully, until I relapsed in september of 2013. At first I used just in the weekends, but gradually I started using more. It's now become a daily thing.
Anyway, I want to stop using this coming friday. I'm very afraid, because I know what's coming. Sickness, sleepless nights etc. But I've done it before and I know I can do it again.
This was just a quick intro, I'll be writing more on friday, when the withdrawals will begin.

I hope this story doesn't come off as bragging, I'm just sharing because this experience was so lucky.
I've posted here before asking for detox help, so thanks to all of you who helped me. I tried to quit cold turkey back in Nov after a full year of daily use (Oxy, or H when I couldn't afford it) but relapsed. I had a month-long trip to Ecuador (mercifully paid for by my father-in-law...because I could not afford that trip on my own) booked for Jan 2 and really wanted to quit opiates before going, but I didn't. I relapsed in November after three days off and used  every day right up until ten minutes before heading for the departure lounge.
My daily dose was 120 mgs a day, or 160 mg when I could afford it. I'm 30 y/o, male, and 140 lbs.
So on Jan 2 I snorted one 40 mg Oxy at 10 AM, then took the other one orally at the airport at 1 PM, and got on the plane thinking ""Oh my god the next ten days are going to be BRUTAL.""
I landed in Guayaquil at midnight Eastern time already feeling sick and went straight to bed in the hostel. The next day I woke up feeling even worse and walked to the bus station to head out to the coast. On the way I hit a pharmacy and bought a pack of Tramadol, 10 capsules, 50mg ea. I took two Tram on the bus and passed out. When I got to Montanita I went straight to bed.
The next day I didn't take any Tramadol at all and, though I was very tired and had some minor chills, it was nothing like the seven attempted detoxes I'd gone through the previous year back in Toronto. The following day I took another two Tramadol and then used no opiates at all for the rest of the trip. 
For the first week I had all the usual insomnia but nothing close to what I usually experienced. I was able to drink (in moderation) without feeling nauseous and depressed, and my appetite returned by the fourth day. There was plenty of gastrointestinal distress, but again, nothing like I experienced in my previous detox attempts. I will admit to using cocaine seven or eight times during the trip, a drug I'd done maybe five times total up to that point in my life.

Anyway, dope sickness-wise, I have NO IDEA how I got off so lightly but I suspect a lot of it must have been mental. My previous detox attempts were very very dark, full of vomiting, shitting, crying and suicidal ideation. Being a warm, beautiful climate somehow helped. I know this might seem like asshole advice, because I know a lot of us are struggling financially because of our addictions, but I recommend detoxing in a warm, sunny climate if at all possible. One of the hardest things for me was staring ahead at my un-opiated life stretching ahead of me and seeing NOTHING to look forward to. Now I see that there is a life beyond opiates. I loved Ecuador so much that I'm trying to move there permanently this November. I finally found something I like more than opiates.

I'm back in Toronto now and have remained sober (though again, I've been drinking occasionally. Drinking doesn't trigger opiate cravings, so I haven't yet been tempted).

So,  I've been lurking this subreddit for the past month or so and tonight I posted my first response to someone's post so I figured I'd take a second to just check in and start to get more active here post-wise. 
This page has been a huge source of motivation for me to quit (I actually did 6 months in rehab this year after using bth for 4 years, but I relapsed about two weeks after getting out.  My relapse will hit the 3 month mark next week and I REALLY want to stop using and start accumulating clean time again)

So,  I've been lurking this subreddit for the past month or so and tonight I posted my first response to someone's post so I figured I'd take a second to just check in and start to get more active here post-wise. 
This page has been a huge source of motivation for me to quit (I actually did 6 months in rehab this year after using bth for 4 years, but I relapsed about two weeks after getting out.  My relapse will hit the 3 month mark next week and I REALLY want to stop using and start accumulating clean time again)

First off a little backstory. I've been using heroin regularly for about 8 months. I can count my IV use on my fingers but mainly snort it. My use in this period varies from twice a week (mainly when I started) up to 5-6 days a week, but usually 3-4. I don't really get phscially sick, I get really low energy and RLS and some trouble sleeping but not bad flu or puking (I still attend work and my classes while not using). The mental withdrawals are killing me, I crave sooo hard and my anxiety and depression, racing thoughts and guilty feelings blow up sky high. I have recently started going to an intensive outpatient rehab program (IOP) which has been going pretty good, I was clean for 6 days, and 5 before that, which hasnt happened in a while since the early months. Before starting IOP, i couldnt go more than 2 days even when trying to stop. However,  a lot of these days were due to it not being possible to use (no money etc.) Anyways, I relapsed yesterday, and used again tonight. When I started IOP they told me to try without suboxone, which makes sense to me seeing as I didn't use everyday anyways. They mentioned if I need subs I could try them, which I don't understand. Do they do anything for craving? Did the IOP people recommend this for the opiate blocking propety? 2 of the guys there who I talked to about suboxone swear its great for their cravings. I'm not sure though if they detoxed first or if it's totally required for them to not be sick. I'm also a bit worried about it replacing an addiction for another but then again I've been on SNRI antidepressants forever, and used to be prescribed klonopin which are both habit forming so at this point I'm open to it, especially if it well help me get back to a normal life.

Long-time lurker, first time poster.  Never felt the need to post on Reddit, but finally it feels like its time.  I have 6 months clean (on subs 6mg down from 10mg, but I'm living the recovery lifestyle which is the most important part to me).

So I have a long but I think interesting story of how I got into recovery, feel free to read...

I am a resident physician (doctor finishing my training- 1.5 years to go) and have been addicted since 25 years old.  It started when I was 25 and very socially isolated, grinding my way through medical school.  I became very depressed, and instead of seeking help, I decided to experiment with drugs.  I tried a few different substances, but immediately loved the opiate high.  Over about 6 months I progressed from using oxycodone, hydromorphone and poppy seed tea orally, to snorting, to injecting.  I rationalized the injecting as a ""less expensive"" option (since you use less of the substance), but in retrospect it was just my addiction progressing.

At first, I was just using on weekends as a ""treat""- a vacation from my mundane life as a medical student.  Over about 6 months to a year, this progressed to daily use (with many rationalizations along the way, such as ""I'm a better doctor on opiates- I'm less stressed out"", ""I function better on opiates- I'm happier"" and so on).  By the age of 26, with a year to go in medical school, I was using daily.  I was spending my student loans on opiates and starting to run out of money.  I rationalized that heroin was cheaper than pills, so made the jump to IV heroin (while also using poppy seed tea for its longer acting effects, to get me through long shifts).

I graduated medical school and passed my licensure exam using daily.  I basically just worked and used- that was my life.  No social life, no extracurriculars, no volunteering.  There was no room for anything except work and drugs.  I tried to get clean to pass my licensure exam, but found I couldn't study in withdrawal/PAWS.  This was the first time I realized I was really addicted, and that my knowledge about addiction hadn't stopped me from becoming addicted myself.  It seems obvious in retrospect that I was addicted (considering I had been injecting and using daily), but its amazing how my rationalizations and success blinded me.

This began my first attempts to get clean.  I was riding a roller coaster of using and taking tolerance breaks every 3-4 weeks.  This also helped me to deny my addiction: I could stop every few weeks to decrease my tolerance, so surely I wasn't that addicted.  The result was insane ups and downs: the high of using and the lows of withdrawal.  I abused many different drugs during my withdrawals, just to get me through a week without opiates (baclofen, benzodiazepines, modafinil, meth or speed when I wanted to get a high, loperamide).  All the time rationalizing away my use.

My work performance was beginning to obviously suffer from this roller coaster ride (in retrospect it probably suffered long before this, but my denial blinded me to it).  When I began my residency at age 26, I decided this was my chance to get clean.  I was moving to a new city, closer to my family, and this geographical cure would surely help me to get clean.  Despite numerous previous failed attempts, I decided this time I would ""really try"" (more denial here).  I took a week off work and went through the withdrawal (with the help of substances mentioned above), and began a miserable 4-week stint of staying ""clean"".  I figured alcohol was never my problem and began to drink heavily.  My days consisted of work, then an NA meeting, then drinking heavily (6-15 standard drinks per night).  I relapsed after 4-weeks of this, I decided that I was less functional off opiates (withdrawal/PAWS was really affecting my work performance, in retrospect so was the drinking).  This was the beginning of a cycle of using for a few weeks, ""quitting"" for a week or two, then relapsing when I couldn't function at work.

This continued for a few months, before I sought help.  I had finally broken through some of my denial and realized I couldn't quit on my own.  I sought help through the Wellness program at my university.  I was referred to an addictions doctor who recommended residential treatment for 35 days.  I was shocked, I had expected some outpatient treatment, I couldn't bare the thought of going off work (in my mind, this was the one thing holding me together, since I had no life outside of work and using).  My doctor filled out the paperwork and I signed it grudgingly, thinking that surely something would save me before I would have to go off to treatment.  I would quit on my own and show them.  I begged my addictions doctor to let me keep working, believing I might kill myself if I was forced off work.  I was so deluded and in such deep denial that I couldn't see the writing on the wall: I needed intensive treatment and was a workaholic too.

So I went away to treatment.  I completed the 35 day program but had multiple psychotic episodes while I was there, and have since been diagnosed with schizophrenia as my symptoms have persisted.  I relapsed twice within a month of leaving treatment.  From there, my addictions doctor threatened more treatment if I relapsed again.  I managed to stay clean for 3 months, and then hid my relapse for a further 3 months before I was found out by my doctor.  

Went back to treatment for 28 days and started on suboxone.  Have been clean since then.  I decided to also do a 12 week treatment, but only lasted 6 weeks due to bullying.  So I'm now clean over 6 months (clean date August 26 2016).  The suboxone has really helped, as a sort of ""insurance policy"" against relapsing.  I've been off work since that first treatment center, and am gradually improving my workaholic tendencies.  I will eventually return to work, but must be in secure, long-term recovery first. 

Its been a tough road, but I feel like something has really changed for me this time around in recovery.  I feel more content being clean, and am actually starting to enjoy things.  I now have friends and hobbies.  Life is actually better than I ever thought clean!

Long-time lurker, first time poster.  Never felt the need to post on Reddit, but finally it feels like its time.  I have 6 months clean (on subs 6mg down from 10mg, but I'm living the recovery lifestyle which is the most important part to me).

So I have a long but I think interesting story of how I got into recovery, feel free to read...

I am a resident physician (doctor finishing my training- 1.5 years to go) and have been addicted since 25 years old.  It started when I was 25 and very socially isolated, grinding my way through medical school.  I became very depressed, and instead of seeking help, I decided to experiment with drugs.  I tried a few different substances, but immediately loved the opiate high.  Over about 6 months I progressed from using oxycodone, hydromorphone and poppy seed tea orally, to snorting, to injecting.  I rationalized the injecting as a ""less expensive"" option (since you use less of the substance), but in retrospect it was just my addiction progressing.

At first, I was just using on weekends as a ""treat""- a vacation from my mundane life as a medical student.  Over about 6 months to a year, this progressed to daily use (with many rationalizations along the way, such as ""I'm a better doctor on opiates- I'm less stressed out"", ""I function better on opiates- I'm happier"" and so on).  By the age of 26, with a year to go in medical school, I was using daily.  I was spending my student loans on opiates and starting to run out of money.  I rationalized that heroin was cheaper than pills, so made the jump to IV heroin (while also using poppy seed tea for its longer acting effects, to get me through long shifts).

I graduated medical school and passed my licensure exam using daily.  I basically just worked and used- that was my life.  No social life, no extracurriculars, no volunteering.  There was no room for anything except work and drugs.  I tried to get clean to pass my licensure exam, but found I couldn't study in withdrawal/PAWS.  This was the first time I realized I was really addicted, and that my knowledge about addiction hadn't stopped me from becoming addicted myself.  It seems obvious in retrospect that I was addicted (considering I had been injecting and using daily), but its amazing how my rationalizations and success blinded me.

This began my first attempts to get clean.  I was riding a roller coaster of using and taking tolerance breaks every 3-4 weeks.

This ain't my first rodeo either.

I don't really experience the ""pink cloud"", but I know a lot of people do. But from what I hear when the pink cloud wears off it can be kinda tough, especially when life is knockin' you around. The past two weeks have been really tough for me in that sense, thought I was getting a good position with a company, but shit from my past may have curbed it. My depression has been worse and just feeling pretty shitty lately. 

Once the pink cloud or w/e good feeling you get from those first couple months clean subsides and your back to just plain ol'life and all the problems you had before are still there, realize that this is normal- remember as long as you stay clean you can handle whatever comes your way. But, I know if I pick back up those problems are still going to be there and more importantly they will become worse as I continue to ignore them. 

I just wanted to let those who may be trying to get clean for the first time know that this can happen. The best defense against it is to recognize ""it"". Life is a series of ups and downs, but I promise you from my experience, that once I pick up it becomes just straight down. 

I'm sorry if this comes off as preachy at all, not my intention at all- just hoping to pay some positivity forward.

For the last year, I had been giving my mom all my subs and she would then give me however many I was prescribed each day to prevent this from happening. For some reason, this month I thought maybe I had enough self control to only take what I was prescribed each day. I fucked up. I would have just toughed it out and not taken anything and just persevered through the withdrawals, but I work nights at Walmart. I actually tried working the first night while withdrawing, but it felt like I was dying. I was practically worthless at my job, which nothing but hard labor (I'm a maintenance associate at Walmart). I threw up multiple times during my shift, my whole body was in pain (every joint felt wrecked), along with the usual cold sweats and everything else. It felt as though all of my withdrawal symptoms were even more so severe due to working my body to the max. My job consists of walking around the whole store sweeping (someone one day totaled up how far we walk each day and it came out to over 7 miles), going outside in less than 40 degree weather to get the shopping carts, heavy lifting, and other miscellaneous stuff that are also very taxing on my body.

So now, this is where I need someones help who has been in my shoes. I'm scared about telling my doctor what happened, I fear that he may cut me off and cancel the program. Also, after this month, the doc was going to change my dosage from .5mg/day suboxone to butrans (which is exactly the same as suboxone, but this med comes in lowers dosage to try and eliminate the withdrawals once I jump off the meds altogether) and I'm scared if he doesn't cut me off and we do indeed change to this med, that it will give me withdrawals now that I've relapsed, and when I relapsed, I relapsed hard (taking up to 15 hydro 10s a day). 

So, I'm just wondering if anyone can give me advice based on experience.

tl:dr - 8 months sober, relapsed hard, scared my doc will cut me off and kick me off the program if i tell him what happened. looking for advice

(please read whole thing because the tl:dr doesnt do it justice and I think your reply would be different if you read it)

p.s. my appointment is today in 2.5 hours, so please if anyone has any advice at all, please help me

EDIT: Everyone is saying he's going to find out via drug test - I don't get drug tested. The doc i go to is an MD at a general hospital. I don't go to a sub clinic. The first time I went to the doc, i initially was going there for a recommendation to a sub clinic because that's what i read you were suppose to do. But instead, he went ahead and evaluated me, no drug testing, and prescribed me 24mg/day sub right off the bat. Every since then, i've been going to him once a month and getting a full months script. If i don't tell him, he isn't going to find out. But that isn't right. I'm going to tell him, i'm trying to get clean and I need his trust and he needs my honesty. 

**UPDATE**: He comes in, sits down, and is already talking about moving on to the next step of weening off of subs and onto butrans. I interrupt him telling how it's important I be honest with him if this is to work. I tell him everything I said in the post. He, without a misstep says, ok, it's going to be ok, we're going to continue the program. THAT WAS IT. It didn't phase him... it's as if he expected it sooner or later. I don't blame him... and whether anyone wants to agree with me or not, relapse is just a part of recovery, for some. It doesn't matter how many times you fall down, what matters is how many times you pick yourself up and try it again. Some can do it the first try, but it takes others multiple tries to find their sweet spot and how they prefer to do things.
He goes on to write my Butrans, 20 mcg/hour (FYI, there is 1000 MCG in 1 MG, just to give a little perspective) 7 day each patch (wear one for 7 days, replace with another... rinse and repeat for 4 weeks). It took a few days to get it filled though, no pharmacy had it in stock. I've yet to apply a patch though, waiting a few days for the relapsed opiates to get out of my system.

I can upload a pic of the BuTrans patch, box, and directions if anyone is interested.

Also, if anyone is interested in what the differences are between BuTrans and Suboxone, here's a little bit of info: 

""Butrans and Suboxone both contain Buprenorphine, the primary active ingredient. The difference is the delivery system for the Buprenorphine. Butrans is a TRANSdermal delivery system. Suboxone is a sublinguial delivery system. Both will create a steady-state blood level of buprenorphine in the body when used as directed.
 
Suboxone does contain Naloxone in order to prevent tampering. Naloxone only becomes active if the sublinguial delivery system is tampered with. When Suboxone is used as directed, Naloxone passes through without activation.
 
Buprenorphine (both Butrans and Suboxone) does block the effects of other opioids by virtue of its agonist/partial antagonist relationship with the opioid receptor. Buprenorphine is an opioid receptor ""bully"" kicking everyone else off and away.
 
Now, the other difference between the two is marketing. Butrans is marketed for pain and Suboxone is marketed for the treatment of opioid chemical dependency. In reality, both can be used for either condition.
 
And that is the real story about Butrans and Suboxone.

The first year of using it was more of a recreational thing; 1-2x a week, 30-60mg a night (roxy 30's). I didn't realize I was physically addicted until about a year ago. In that year I've made numerous attempts to get clean and have had moderate success (3-4 weeks clean), but always went back to using.

Every time I tried to quit, it was cold turkey. I have probably gone through withdrawals about 20 times in the last year alone. Literally every other week I would stop and start again. A lot of my relapses were due to my own stupidity in continuing to hang out with addicts. I've since cut those people off, but now find that I am just using on my own.

Lately, my usage has escalated to 5-6 nights a week, and I tried heroin for the first time a few weeks ago, but have not tried it again. Needless to say, I'm starting to scare myself.

I finally decided to try a quick suboxone taper in hopes it would ease the withdrawals. My approach was to use 1mg a night and cut the dosage in half every 4 days. I ended up relapsing after day 4 and going back to oxy. While I felt fine, my dealer texted me and I had one of those ""ahh fuck it"" moments. This was last week...

I still have a few suboxone strips left, but am wondering if I am doing myself more harm then good by messing with subs, as my oxy abuse is on the low side in the grand scheme of things (still at 60mg a night).

So...should I continue to try to ride it out cold turkey, or try the sub approach again?
Any advice is greatly appreciated.

It's now Friday at 8 am, I feel like crap. My ears are ringing, my eyes and nose keep running, I've been in bed for the past 14 hours and I'm aching all over.


This isn't my first withdrawal. I relapsed about 2 months ago. I started out with a half gram. I knew I shouldn't fuck around with it but I was trying to kill myself. I smoked a bunch of it the first night but didn't die. I knew I shouldn't keep going because of the withdrawals but my mind said fuck it. 


I'm such a fucking idiot. I knew what I was getting into. I knew with each day passing/using I would have to go through withdrawals. So why the fuck did I relapsed??


 I had a year and 4 months clean. I was doing great. I just couldn't cope with the stress of my living situation, my family caused me to have a melt down. I was screaming at my family. They wouldn't listen, I felt so alone, I was clean and doing so good but I wanted to die so fucking bad. The depression was getting worse, the anxiety was crippling, now I have to go through it all over again. 


I'm not even 24 hours clean and I'm thinking of either going to a hospital, telling my roommate that I'm a junkie, telling my family I'm a junkie, or just go through this alone and try to get clean without telling anyone because I hid my use for these past two months. 


Part of me wants to pick up but I know I need to quit. I know I need to do this and get through these next 7-10 days.  I just don't know if I can. When I'm asleep I'm in peace so I kind of want to kill myself so I don't have to go through this. I don't want to hurt Everyone but I don't want to detox and feel like shit. It's my own fault. 


Can someone give me some advice? I'm out of work until September 5th. I have plenty of time to detox but I don't know if I should tell my psychiatrist. I've been going to this place for treatment every day for the past 4 months. I really feel like it was helping but I think I'll be letting them down. 


I don't want to be locked up for 30 days or longer. I have gabapentin, weed, ketamine, vitamins, Tylenol, blood pressure medication, veggies for pressed juice, great friends, great family but they are all clueless. I ordered some kratom last night, and paid for over night shipping so it'll get here on Saturday but I think that was a mistake because I might just prolong these withdrawals if I take kratom. Oh and I have a 8mg sub, a quarter of a sub and some crumbs but I'm scared to take it and prolong anything. 


Should I call the local psychiatric hospital, tell them I'm suicidal and withdrawaling from heroin?  I'm scared I'm going to be locked up, put on Suboxone and be stuck on a maintenance drug.


Or should I just tough it out, don't tell anyone, try and not be a pussy and get through this without trying to prolong it? I'm afraid it'll be too much and I'll freak the fuck out, have a meltdown and go to the hospital. I'm afraid I might kill myself. My roommate/best friend is under so much stress that I don't want to hurt him. That's why I can't tell him I'm at junkie. He'd probably disown me, tell all our other friends that I'm a junkie.

And am I gonna die, or be tempted to commit suicide? 24/Male.","Ive been clean off H for a year before I relapsed at the beginning of March this year.

The first time I quit the dope I got into the gym and became a fitness junky; I lifted weights four days out of the week while eating 200 grams of protein daily.

I gained mass and strength and was on my way to sculpting a chiseled physique.

Well I relapsed after going through a dental surgery that meant I couldn't lift weights or eat as much. This lasted three weeks.

I also enrolled back into college to complete an accounting degree - I aced my first semester back in school.

Slowly after the relapse I began to ramp up my H intake. I can safely guess that - from March until this very day - I snorted almost half a gram of H every day save for a few 3 day breaks every now and then.

Im at the point now where I withdrew from one class, spent all my student loan money which was set aside for rent. I got myself a job in a restaurant kitchen. Hopefully this allows me to have an icome to cover monthly rent until September.

Needless to say my addiction has ruined everything I worked hard to rebuild in my life. No one in my circle of friends and family knows the severity of my addiction or that Ive been addicted in the past. The shame and guilt would be unbearable if I confess.

In addition to that my family is a very religious group (muslim) and if they found out that Ive spent all my money on heroin they would scold me and shame me to no end. Id be berated and told to suck it up. They have no clue how painful withdrawal can be and so they would not sympathise in the slightest. They would just see me as a weak, pathetic excuse of a man. 

Now that doesnt really bother me as I am fairly independent and mostly keep to myself - one reason why no one close to me has any idea that Im a few mistakes away from being homeless or dead.

I called an addiction help centre today and inquired about their suboxone treatment program and I found out that not only will it take up to a week before Id see a script, it is prohibitively expensive. 

I start my restaurant job tomorrow evening and Im planning on just going cold turkey as of now. My plan is to earn my first cheque in 2 weeks time then reactivate my gym membership where I'll get back into my routine of weight lifting. Hopefully the coming two weeks will give me some recovery time to energize myself to go back gym.

So finally, my question is how severe are withdrawals gonna be for my habit. I can deal with most of the symptoms except for 3 of them. 

The insomnia that leaves me mentally unfit to get anything done during the day. The spikes in anxiety that shorten my breath and push me to the point of fear I might easily break down and cry. And finally the feeling of coldness that freezes me to my bones.

Thanks for all the support I can get from anyone willing to talk to me about this.

I was an avid reader and occasional contributor to this sub a couple years back, but I've made a throwaway because a couple people IRL know my other username.

I just wanted to share my recent experiences and ask for any similar experiences or advice.  I'm 28, and have been addicted to opiates in one form or another for 12 years.  I've had periods of abstinence, and periods of genuine recovery/sobriety (in 12 step programs).  I am currently stuck in a constant loop of relapse/""recovery.""

About 2 years ago I got fed up with my dependence on heroin (~1g/day habbit).  Luckily I was able to keep my insurance and job, so I went about finding a suboxone doctor.  The doctor I went to seemed to ask me what I wanted rather than prescribing me what he thought I needed.  That was a bad sign, and I shouldn't have trusted him, but my inner addict said, ""yeah, this is the perfect guy to help me.""  He prescribed me 8mg/day of suboxone, and said we'd taper as we went.  I'd done the whole suboxone thing before, so I was doubtful, but went along desperate to believe.

Perhaps because I was so fed up with my disease, or because I was just out of options, I actually managed to quit everything else, taking only the prescribed dosage of the suboxone each day.  Oh, I should mention that I also got re-prescribed to Vyvanse by the same doctor, which I may or may not need for ADD (I type that knowing I don't *need* need it, but really just want it, because, you know, speed).  With that predictable, innocuous pseudo-speedball each morning, my life actually got back on track.  

I cleaned my act up, finished a degree... blah blah blah.  Hell, I even started to attend meetings again.  I'm glad I rediscovered a program, because with the suboxone alone, I became so unbelievably depressed and isolated that suicide seemed more appropriate than a shot of dope.  But alas, my first mistake in this tragic 2 year fuckup:  I lied about being on detox meds to my support group, because hey, people in the meetings really hated on suboxone, lumping it in with methadone, even saying stuff like, ""you might as well still be using if you're on that shit.""  So fastforward a couple of months, I'm getting keytags and chips and, despite my *little* secret about the meds I am on, I felt a genuine fellowship and happiness.  The promises were coming true and I was riding my pink cloud like a mother fucking boss.

When I picked up my year medallion it was truly a happy moment for me, as well as for the wonderful people with whom I've become so close.  I felt accomplished, renewed, full of promise.  The only dark cloud in that otherwise clear horizon was my inner-conflict regarding the suboxone and vyvanse.  The dose had only gone down once in that first year, which I knew was really odd for a taper schedule.  The doctor suggested one small taper early in the year of monthly visits (second month), which I obliged to, but he never asked again.  Around month 4 I suggested a drop, but he said with my history it would be best to stay at 4 mg.

After my miraculous 1-year celebration, I felt it was time to get serious and kick the suboxone.  I wrote out a personal taper schedule, informed the doctor of my plan, and with his endorsement I began a 3 month campaign to kick the subs.  I went from 4mg/day; to 4mg/36hrs; to 2mg/day... that's where I found my disease was still alive and well.

About 4 months ago I relapsed in the same way I always have.  Called the same number that's been in service for fucking years, asked where the spot was at, then took 100 bucks out from my savings.  Well, gee-wiz, would you believe it, I didn't do it just that once, as I somewhat-sarcastically promised myself the day of my relapse.  I remember thinking ""just tonight,"" then literally laughing out loud at the very notion.  Within a week I was back up to .5g/day habbit.  I emptied my savings (~15k) in a few months, and wrecked every relationship outside of the rooms.  Meanwhile, I still went to meetings because I guess I had no other friends.  My girlfriend, clean 6 years, started getting suspicious, so I acted like a dick until she left me alone for good.

That brings us to now.  I'm sitting alone behind my laptop, wondering how to pick up a white chip.  I have no humility, that would require a fucking soul.  The last month has been a time-warp.  Use my paycheck up, take suboxone to kill the WDs, and wait until my next check.  It's unbearable again, and all my friends in the programs have no clue (well, one might).  I wish I could express the pain of this cycle.  I want to be truly clean, not stuck on these fucking meds.  They make me function, but apparently that's only building me up to fall all over again.

Sorry, that was a wall of text.  Please let me know how you're living, or how you got through a similar situation.  Or just make fun of me, I would welcome the distraction.

I emptied my savings (~15k) in a few months, and wrecked every relationship outside of the rooms.  Meanwhile, I still went to meetings because I guess I had no other friends.  My girlfriend, clean 6 years, started getting suspicious, so I acted like a dick until she left me alone for good.

That brings us to now.  I'm sitting alone behind my laptop, wondering how to pick up a white chip.  I have no humility, that would require a fucking soul.  The last month has been a time-warp.  Use my paycheck up, take suboxone to kill the WDs, and wait until my next check.  It's unbearable again, and all my friends in the programs have no clue (well, one might).  I wish I could express the pain of this cycle.  I want to be truly clean, not stuck on these fucking meds.  They make me function, but apparently that's only building me up to fall all over again.

Sorry, that was a wall of text.  Please let me know how you're living, or how you got through a similar situation.  Or just make fun of me, I would welcome the distraction.
